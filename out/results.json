    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nAmong the most impacted regions around the world by recent\nclimate change is the central Himalaya. In recent decades, this\nregion has experienced rapidly increasing temperature1–3 and\ndecreasing monsoon precipitation.4 These meteorological trends\nare likely major factors in the rapid retreat of glaciers in the\nregion.5–7 These glaciers are depended upon as reservoirs of\nmoisture, which provide water for agriculture, hydropower, and\nhousehold use as they melt annually. Melting of snow and ice\nprovides a third of annual discharge in the central Himalaya.8\nMore broadly, the central Himalaya is the source of some of the\nworld’s great rivers, including the Ganges and Brahmaputra, so\nthat precipitation in the region is critical to water resources in the\nIndian subcontinent.\nReanalyses show an upper-tropospheric circulation trend over\nAsia in recent decades with an increasing influence of westerlies at\nlow latitudes in recent decades (Fig. 1a), as found by Mölg et al.9\nThis westerly trend is linked to a cyclonic trend over West Asia and\nand an anti-cyclonic trend over East Asia. The center of the anti-\ncyclonic trend approximately corresponds to one of the centers of\naction of the major teleconnection pattern over Eurasia in the\nboreal summer known as the “Silk Road Pattern,” with the late\n1990s being identified as a shifting point.10 This regional trend\nrepresents a disturbance to the upper-tropospheric circulation\nover Asia during the Indian summer monsoon since 1979.\nTo understand the impact of the regional trend on mesoscale\ncirculations in the Himalaya, a 36-year dynamical downscaling was\nperformed11 from 1979 to 2015 at 6.7-km grid spacing over a\nregion covering the Tibetan Plateau, the Himalaya, and the\nKarakoram (Fig. 1—domain boundaries shown in panel a and\ninner domain plotted in panels b, c). The downscaling employed\nthe Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model,12 with\nClimate Forecast System Reanalyses (CFSR13) for initial and\nboundary\nconditions.\nThe\ndownscaling\nwas\nperformed\nto\ninvestigate the contrasting behavior between the central Hima-\nlaya and Karakoram glaciers,11 where the latter are not uniformly\nretreating.14–17 The downscaling shows the central Himalaya has\nexperienced surface warming and drying since 1979 (shown for\nsummer in Fig. 1b, c).\nThis dynamical downscaling was previously used to calculate\ntrends from seasonally averaged variables.11 However, the Indian\nsummer monsoon, during which almost all of the annual\nprecipitation over the central Himalaya falls,18 is associated with\na pronounced diurnal cycle over the Himalaya.19–23 Daytime\nheating\nof\nthe\nslopes\ngenerates\na\nhorizontal\npotential-\ntemperature gradient, resulting in an upslope acceleration of the\nwinds; at night, radiative cooling of the slopes creates an\nopposite-signed temperature gradient, resulting in a downslope\nacceleration\nof\nthe\nwinds.24\nThis\ndiurnal\ncycle\nmaximizes\nprecipitation over the peaks in the daytime and in valleys at\nnight.19,23 To highlight this local circulation, the analysis in the\ncurrent study is restricted to a small subregion spanning 86–92°E\nand 26–29°N (Fig. 1d, location shown in Fig. 1b, c), corresponding\nto the glaciated areas of the central/eastern Himalaya, just during\nsummer months (JJA). This subregion was chosen for analysis\nbecause of the co-location of significant drying (Fig. 1b) and\nwarming (Fig. 1c) trends over the Himalaya during JJA.\nThis study examines trends in the diurnal cycle in this subregion\nin JJA. The diurnal cycles of precipitation, temperature, and winds\nusing this WRF configuration over the Himalaya in JJA have been\nevaluated,23 as have the daily averaged trends (1979–2014)\nidentified by the downscaling.11 In both studies, the level of\nagreement with observations was sufficient to justify an analysis\nof the trends in the diurnal cycle using the same downscaling.\nHere, we hypothesize that the warming and drying over the\ncentral Himalaya demonstrated by the downscaling (Fig. 1b, c\n\n[TRUNCATED]",

Haerter1,2,3✉, Bettina Meyer\n1 and Silas Boye Nissen\n1\nConvective self-aggregation is a modelling paradigm for convective rain cell organisation over a constant-temperature tropical sea\nsurface. This set-up can give rise to cloud clusters developing over timescales of weeks. In reality, sea-surface temperatures do\noscillate diurnally, affecting the atmospheric state and influencing rain rates significantly. Over land, surface temperatures vary\nmore strongly. Here, we carry out a suite of cloud-resolving numerical experiments, and find that qualitatively different dynamics\nemerge from modest surface temperature oscillations: while the spatial distribution of rainfall is homogeneous during the first day,\nalready on the second day, the rain field is firmly structured. In later days, this clustering becomes stronger and alternates from day\nto day. We show that these features are robust to changes in resolution, domain size and mean surface temperature, but can be\nremoved by a reduction of the amplitude of diurnal surface temperature oscillation, suggesting a transition from a random to a\nclustered state. Maximal clustering occurs at a scale of lmax \u0001 180 km, which we relate to the emergence of mesoscale convective\nsystems. At lmax, rainfall is strongly enhanced and far exceeds the rainfall expected at random. Simple conceptual modelling helps\ninterpret the transition to clustering, which is driven by the formation of mesoscale convective systems, and brings about day-to-\nday moisture oscillations. Our results may help clarify how continental extremes build up, and how cloud clustering over the\ntropical ocean could emerge as an instance of spontaneous symmetry breaking at timescales much faster than in conventional\nradiative–convective equilibrium self-aggregation.",
    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nDue to their relatively low resolution, current general circulation\nmodels\ncannot\nsimulate\nmesoscale\nconvective\norganisation\nexplicitly1. Yet, the recent observed positive trend in regional\ntropical rainfall was stated to predominantly stem from changes in\nthe frequency of organised deep convection2. Similarly, in mid-\nlatitudes, the majority of flood-producing rain was attributed to\nmesoscale convective systems (MCSs)3,4. In line with Moeng and\nLeMone5, we here take MCSs to be long-lived complexes of rain\ncells spanning ~100 km in diameter. Over continental regions, the\nclustering of convection in an MCS poses a risk to humans as\nsevere storms can lead to intense downdraughts and flash\nflooding3,4,6,7. Pronounced long-lived clustering can be simulated\nin a process known as convective self-aggregation forming over\nthe timescale of weeks8–10. There, the radiative–convective\nequilibrium (RCE) experimental set-up11,12 is usually employed,\nassuming spatially and temporally constant surface temperature\n(~300 K). In RCE self-aggregation, radiation feedbacks have\nemerged as the “smoking gun” for sustaining and increasing\nclustering8. Still, factors such as sea-surface temperature feed-\nbacks13, domain size, geometry and resolution10, as well as\nperiodically varying insolation14,15 or cold-pool effects16,17 were\nalso stated to influence RCE self-aggregation.\nPrescribing constant boundary conditions is an elegant model\nsimplification, but it is not always realistic. Diurnal sea-surface\ntemperature amplitudes can be as large as two18,19 to five20\nKelvin, especially under weak surface wind conditions and strong\ninsolation.\nDiurnal\nsurface\ntemperature\namplitudes\nof\nthis\nmagnitude change the properties of the atmosphere20, resulting\nin diurnally varying precipitation intensity and affecting large-\nscale phenomena, such as the Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO) or\nthe El Niño phenomenon. Satellite observations show a diurnal\ncycle\nin\ncloud\nheight\nfor\nthe\nMJO21,22.\nDiurnally\nvarying\nprecipitation intensity also emerges from numerical simulations\nthat account for differences in insolation23. Further, in contrast to\nRCE self-aggregation simulations, observed tropical cloud clusters\ntypically are more transient, as they often persist for less than two\ndays24.\nMechanistically, cold pools (CPs), that is, denser air formed by\nrain evaporation under convective clouds, were long implicated in\nthe organisation of convection25,26, both by thermodynamic and\nmechanical effects27–31, and were suggested to lead to cluster-\ning32,33. In the following, when referring to MCS, we take this to\nencompass both the cluster of deep convective cells and the\nassociated CPs, which are often long-lived. The continental diurnal\ncycle of deep convection is characterised by an afternoon or\nevening peak in rainfall31,34–38. Over the ocean, this daily period\ncan further be modulated by bi–diurnal oscillations, a dynamics\nobserved by Chen and Houze for local cloudiness in MCSs and\nreferred to as “diurnal dancing”39.\nPrevious studies of convective self-organisation under diurnally\nvarying surface temperature either did not address the emergence\nof MCSs or simulated a relatively small domain37. Current state-of-\nthe-art regional climate models are now capable of simulating\nmuch larger areas (beyond 1000 km horizontally at kilometre\nresolution)40–43. Encompassing features, such as terrain variation\nand inhomogeneous external forcing, adds unique regional\ninsight but makes mechanistic analysis of self-organised clustering\nmore cumbersome.\nThrough\nan\nidealised\nset-up,\nwe\nanalyse\nthe\nmulti-day\norganisation in the convective rain field over land and sea. In\nour set-up, surface heating is spatially homogeneous but oscillates\ndiurnally. Our focus is on the spontaneous emergence of\nclustering. We show that a transition from a homogeneous to a\nstrongly clustered state occurs spontaneously when the amplitude\nof the diurnal surface temperature oscillation is sufficiently large\n\n[TRUNCATED]",

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nStratospheric water vapor (SWV) plays an important role in\nregulating the global radiation budget, energy balance, strato-\nspheric temperature and chemical processes, and global climate\nchange1–5. Increases and decreases in SWV have been found to\nstrengthen and offset global warming effects, respectively6,7.\nTherefore, understanding the variations and controlling factors of\nSWV is important for the prediction of global climate change.\nThe main source of water vapor in the middle and upper\nstratosphere is methane oxidation in the stratosphere8,9, but in the\nlower and middle stratosphere the main source is the transport of\nair through upwelling from the tropical tropopause layer (TTL) into\nthe stratosphere10,11. The influence of SWV variations on climate\nchange is mainly caused by the variations in the lower and middle\nstratosphere6. Brewer12 first showed the large-scale transport of\ntropospheric air into the stratosphere in the tropics and its\ndehydration by cold temperatures near the tropical tropopause.\nTherefore, vertical transport is a factor affecting the variations of\nwater vapor in the lower stratosphere. Tropical lower SWV (LSWV)\nchanges have been an active research topic in recent years. Many\nstudies have investigated LSWV variations and their link with\nglobal climate change13–16.\nIt is well known that tropical tropopause temperature is the\nmain factor controlling tropical SWV through dehydration12,17–26,\nas determined by dynamical, radiative, and chemical processes in\nthe TTL27–29. The TTL is not just a geometric surface, but is rather a\nthin layer with spatial structure, and various physical processes in\nTTL affect water vapor transport through this channel into the\nstratosphere11,30,31. Weakening (strengthening) of the strato-\nspheric\nBrewer–Dobson\n(BD)\ncirculation\n(e.g.,\nBirner\nand\nBönisch32) driven by extratropical stratospheric waves increases\n(decreases) the tropopause temperature4,5,33–35. In addition, the\ntemperature of the TTL is also driven by equatorial planetary\nwaves including both tropical Rossby and Kelvin waves. Several\nstudies have demonstrated that penetrating deep convection\nsystems can contribute to LSWV28,36–38. Tropical deep convection\ncools the upper part of the TTL through wave-induced upward\nmotion near the tropopause23,39,40.\nAs El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) can influence the\ntropical upwelling and tropopause temperature41,42, it is one of\nthe most important processes controlling LSWV changes on\ninterannual time scales. The enhanced tropical upwelling warms\nthe upper troposphere and cools the lower stratosphere in the\ntropics during El Niño phases43–46, influencing large-scale tropical\nwater vapor concentrations18,20,47–50. The vertical propagation of\nultralong Rossby waves is intensified during El Niño activity in the\nNorthern Hemisphere (NH) during NH winter. Observational\ndatasets show anomalous increased wave dissipation in the\nstratosphere in the NH middle and high latitudes, warming the\nArctic stratosphere and cooling the equatorial stratosphere44,51–55.\nThis is also supported by simulations43,50,56–61. La Niña activity has\nthe opposite effect on the middle-latitude and polar strato-\nsphere44,61–65.\nIn recent decades, a change in the ENSO anomaly pattern,\nreferred to as the Central Pacific (CP) ENSO (or ENSO Modoki),\nwhich is distinct from the familiar Eastern Pacific (EP) ENSO\n(canonical ENSO), has gradually become apparent66,67. The\ngradient pattern of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies\n(SSTA) of El Niño Modoki leads to a different pattern of\npropagation and dissipation of ultralong Rossby waves in the\nmiddle-latitude stratosphere that can affect the stratosphere,\nunlike the case for the canonical El Niño. Thus, the climatic effects\nof ENSO Modoki on stratospheric circulation are different from\nthose of the canonical ENSO50,63,68–75. The variations in convection\nand circulation patterns resulting from SSTAs have been shown to\nsignificantly influence tropopause \n\n[TRUNCATED]",

Samset\n1,\nDrew Shindell\n12, Christopher J. Smith\n13,14, Toshihiko Takemura\n15 and Apostolos Voulgarakis\n8\nRapid adjustments occur after initial perturbation of an external climate driver (e.g., CO2) and involve changes in, e.g. atmospheric\ntemperature, water vapour and clouds, independent of sea surface temperature changes. Knowledge of such adjustments is\nnecessary to estimate effective radiative forcing (ERF), a useful indicator of surface temperature change, and to understand global\nprecipitation changes due to different drivers. Yet, rapid adjustments have not previously been analysed in any detail for certain\ncompounds, including halocarbons and N2O. Here we use several global climate models combined with radiative kernel\ncalculations to show that individual rapid adjustment terms due to CFC-11, CFC-12 and N2O are substantial, but that the resulting\nflux changes approximately cancel at the top-of-atmosphere due to compensating effects. Our results further indicate that radiative\nforcing (which includes stratospheric temperature adjustment) is a reasonable approximation for ERF. These CFCs lead to a larger\nincrease in precipitation per kelvin surface temperature change (2.2 ± 0.3% K−1) compared to other well-mixed greenhouse gases\n(1.4 ± 0.3% K−1 for CO2). This is largely due to rapid upper tropospheric warming and cloud adjustments, which lead to enhanced\natmospheric radiative cooling (and hence a precipitation increase) and partly compensate increased atmospheric radiative heating\n(i.e. which is associated with a precipitation decrease) from the instantaneous perturbation.\nnpj Climate and Atmospheric Science (2020) 3:43 ; \nOzone-depleting halocarbons and nitrous oxide (N2O) are well-\nmixed greenhouse gases that have contributed substantially to\nradiative forcing (RF) since pre-industrial time, by 0.33 ± 0.03 W\nm−2 (0.18 ± 0.17 W m−2 when including stratospheric ozone\ndepletion) and 0.17 ± 0.03 W m−2, respectively1. A substantial\ncontribution to global warming and Arctic sea-ice loss in the\nlatter half of the 20th century was recently attributed to ozone-\ndepleting substances2,3. Atmospheric lifetimes of chlorofluorocar-\nbons (CFCs), an important group of ozone-depleting halocarbons,\nare typically several decades or centuries4. Their impact on climate\nwill therefore remain strong for many years to come despite\nregulations\nof\nhalocarbon\nemissions\nthrough\nthe\nMontreal\nProtocol signed in 1987.\nMost halocarbons, such as CFC-12, have their main infrared\nabsorption bands at different spectral wavelengths compared to\nthe two main anthropogenic greenhouse gases CO2 and methane\n(CH4), in the so-called atmospheric window region around\n800–1200 cm−1 where the RF efficiency is strong5,6. The main\ninfrared absorption bands of N2O partly overlap with CH4, but an\nimportant difference is that CH4 has more significant shortwave\n(SW) absorption bands7,8. Although these factors may imply that\nthe climate effects of halocarbons and N2O differ from those of\nCO2 and CH4, relatively little is known about the details of short\nand long-term responses of halocarbons and N2O on climate.\nWhile numerous studies exist on radiative transfer modelling of\nhalocarbons, only a few studies have performed global climate\nmodel (GCM) experiments to investigate the climate effects of\nhalocarbons separately. Hansen et al.9,10 found that the surface\ntemperature response to a large forcing of CFCs and N2O had very\nsimilar geographical patterns as the response to CO2 and CH4\nforcing. The efficacies (i.e. the warming per unit RF) for CFCs were,\nhowever, around 30% larger than for CO2, but close to unity for\nCFCs and N2O when rapid adjustments were accounte\n\n[TRUNCATED]",

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nA large fraction of 1.4 billion people in India depends on\nagriculture for their livelihood. Agriculture contributes consider-\nably to the Indian gross domestic product (GDP)1. Weather and\nclimate extremes hamper food production, farm-income, and\noverall\nwell-being\nof\nthe\npeople\nliving\nin\nIndia2–6.\nIndia\nexperiences droughts that can lead to a prolonged period of\nwater scarcity7,8. Droughts pose deleterious impacts on natural\nresources, crop production, and environment1,8–10. Since the\nsummer monsoon rainfall is the primary source of surface water\navailability in the large part of the country, the onset of droughts\nin India is well associated with the failure of the summer\nmonsoon1,11. Year-to-year variability of the summer monsoon\nprecipitation in India is linked with the large-scale atmospheric\nand oceanic forcing7,12,13. Positive sea surface temperature (SST)\nanomalies over the central Pacific Ocean (El Nino) often result in\nweaker summer monsoon leading to meteorological droughts in\nIndia1,9,14. Persistent meteorological droughts translate to agricul-\ntural and hydrological droughts, which cause devastating impacts\non food production and water availability in the country15–17.\nCauses and consequences of droughts caused by the failure of\nthe summer monsoon in India are well studied1,12,18–20. However,\ndrivers and impacts of flash droughts21,22 in India are not\nexamined. Flash droughts occur due to the rapid depletion of\nsoil moisture caused either by precipitation deficit or increased air\ntemperature or both21–25. Favourable crop growing conditions can\ntranslate to extreme dry conditions within a few days to weeks\ndue to flash droughts22,26. Therefore, flash droughts in the crop\ngrowing season adversely affect agriculture and ecosystem\nleading to considerable economic losses26–28. Understanding of\nflash droughts in India is vital as agricultural activities heavily rely\non the summer monsoon and groundwater based irrigation9,29.\nThus, the increased frequency of flash droughts during the crop\ngrowing season can result in increased irrigation demands.\nIncreased irrigation demands in a large area in short-time can\nlead to increased groundwater pumping from the already\ndepleting aquifers in India29,30.\nIndia is projected to witness extreme climatic conditions in the\nfuture9,31–35. Extreme hot and dry conditions that lead to flash\ndroughts can occur more frequently under climate change32.\nHowever, increased risk of flash droughts under a warming\nclimate is less recognized22,36,37 in comparison to conventional\ndroughts38–42. Given the significant rise in the warming that is\nprojected in the future in India31,32,43,44, the risk of flash droughts\nin the future in India seems unavoidable. However, the changes in\nthe frequency and characteristics of flash droughts in India are not\nexamined. Here, we use observations and large ensemble\nsimulations from the Community Earth System Model (CESM-\nLENS) to reconstruct root-zone soil moisture for the observed\n(1951–2016) and future climate. The root-zone soil moisture was\nused to examine the role of anthropogenic warming on the\nprojected changes in the frequency of flash droughts in India.\nRESULTS\nFlash droughts in the observed climate, 1951–2016\nFirst, we identify the major flash droughts that occurred during\nthe observed climate (1951–2016) in India. We used the VIC model\nsimulated soil moisture using the observed meteorological forcing\nfrom the India meteorological department (IMD45,46). The VIC\nmodel estimates evapotranspiration using Penman–Monteith\nmethod, which avoids uncertainty that can arise due to estimation\nof evaporative demands based on just temperature47,48. Due to\nthe lack of long-term root-zone soil moisture observations, soil\nmoisture simulated using the land surface models has been widely\nused for the drought assessment17,18,49,50.

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nAsia is one of the most vulnerable regions facing climate change\nrisks because of its large and dense population, rapid industrial\ndevelopment, and severe water stress1,2. Climate change due to\nanthropogenic factors, such as greenhouse gases (GHGs), aerosols,\nand land use, has seriously impacted natural ecosystems (e.g.,\nagriculture, biodiversity, water, and ocean) and human society in\nAsia3,4. Asia also features the highest loading of anthropogenic\naerosols (AA) over the globe5. The absolute value of aerosol\nradiative forcing is even larger than GHG in Asia during certain\nperiods6.\nMany studies have shown that AA forcing is a key factor driving\nhistorical climate change over Asia7–11. A widespread summertime\ndrying in South Asia during the second half of the 20th century\nhas been primarily attributed to increased AA7. Regional aerosol-\ncloud interaction could be responsible for changes in extreme\nrainfall over India and China during 1979–20059. Recent studies\nalso showed that AA forcing dominated the observed interdecadal\nupper-tropospheric cooling over East Asia during summer10 and\nweakening of the East Asian summer monsoon after the 1950s11.\nMostly, these attribution studies rely on global climate models\n(GCMs), especially from the previous four phases of Coupled\nModel Intercomparison Project (CMIP). Attribution works pub-\nlished in the last years to quantify human impact on observed\nclimate trends, especially aerosol’s role, focused on the late 20th\ncentury when AA emissions increase monotonically in Asia. The\nconsideration of the more recent period of the first two decades of\nthe 21st century is usually limited by the fact that the various\nspecially designed “historical” experiment setup of CMIP5 ends in\n2005. The latest CMIP612 has extended the historical simulation up\nto 2014, thus enabling the attribution of a more recent period.\nHowever, robust quantification of the role of aerosols in historical\nclimate trends requires a correct representation of the spatio-\ntemporal variation of aerosols in GCMs, which can be problematic\nin the early 21st century, because the fast economic growth is also\naccompanied by increasingly stricter air pollution regulations in\nChina13 and India14.\nHere we examine the simulated 2006–2014 trends in aerosol\noptical depths (AODs) at 550 nm over Asia (India and China) in the\nhistorical simulations of the 32 CMIP6 models. We explain the\nmodel-observation discrepancy by tracking the emissions inven-\ntory assumption, as in Paulot et al.15. We estimate the impact of\nalternative AA emissions inventories on effective radiative forcing\n(ERF) using a global aerosol-climate model.

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nIn recent decades, especially since 2003, Europe has experienced\nan exceptional number of pronounced heat wave events (HW) in\nsummer,1–4 and these events have had disastrous impacts on local\ncommunities and economies.5–7 The causes of these European\nheat waves are complex, and many studies have primarily\nattributed them to the possible impacts of large-scale atmospheric\ncirculation patterns, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO),8\nand the midlatitude planetary waves,9–11 as well as ocean and\nland surface thermal conditions, such as the El Niño–Southern\nOscillation (ENSO),12 North Atlantic warming,13 and Eurasian soil\nmoisture variations.14,15 Other studies have noted that anthro-\npogenic global warming, particularly the Arctic temperature\namplification, has contributed to the increasing number of\nsummer heat wave events in Europe.3,16 During this process, heat\nwaves are often associated with anomalous circulation patterns\ncharacterized by the weakening of the zonal mean jets, the quasi-\nresonant amplification of planetary waves,9–11,17 and persistent\nblocking conditions12,18 over the midlatitude Eurasia that produce\nprolonged hot surface conditions. The weakening of the zonal\nmean jets is generally due to the reduction of the equator-to-pole\nthermal gradient associated with changing surface conditions.\nQuasi-stationary midlatitude waves are most likely amplified by\nthe quasi-resonance between free and forced waves in wave-\nguides with zonal wavenumbers of 6 ~ 8. For example, the\nEuropean heat wave in 2003 and the Russian heat wave in 2010\nwere associated with the strong amplification of midlatitude\nquasi-stationary waves.9,10 The occurrence of a 2010 Russian heat\nwave\nwas\nassociated\nwith\npersistent\nblockings\nin\nthe\nEuropean–Western Russian region.12,18\nThese frequent and amplified extreme heat waves in Europe\nhave been accompanied by record declines in Arctic sea ice19 and\nEurasian snow cover.20 In particular, in spring and summer they\nhave dramatically diminished since the 1980s.

Greater sea-spray nuclei availability mostly suppresses\nsulfate aerosol activation leading to an overall decrease in cloud droplet concentrations; however, for high vertical updrafts and low\nsulfate aerosol availability, increased sea-spray can augment cloud droplet concentrations. This newly identified effect where sea-\nsalt nuclei indirectly controls sulfate nuclei activation into cloud droplets could potentially lead to changes in the albedo of marine\nboundary layer clouds by as much as 30%.",
    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nIt has long been considered that increasing the abundance of\ncloud condensation nuclei (CCN) in optically thin clouds would\nlead to increased reflectance at cloud top (the 1st indirect aerosol\nradiative effect)1, and extended lifetime due to delays in\nprecipitation onset (the 2nd indirect aerosol radiative effect)2.\nBoth effects lead to an increase in planetary albedo, thereby partly\noffsetting warming caused by an accumulation of greenhouse\ngases in the atmosphere. Because of their high susceptibility, and\nthe high sunlight absorption of the underlying oceanic surface,\nmarine clouds are thought to be particularly important con-\ntributors to the aerosol-cloud-radiation cooling effect—for exam-\nple, a 20–35% increase in low-level cloud amount could offset a\ndoubling of CO2\n3–5. The potential role of marine clouds in\nregulating climate led to suggestions of various feedback cycles\ninvolving both primary (i.e. bubble-mediated sea-spray) marine\naerosol\nproduction6\nand\nsecondary\n(gas-to-particle)\nmarine\naerosol production7. For primary production of sea-salt, it was\nsuggested that zonal wind speeds would increase with rising\nglobal temperatures, leading to increased sea-salt fluxes to the\natmosphere6; while plankton activity was suggested to increase\nwith rising temperatures, leading to increased emissions of\nbiogenic sulfur gases from the ocean surface, increasing sulfate\naerosol formation, ultimately increasing the availability of CCN7.\nIn general, an increased number concentration of CCN within a\ncloud-topped boundary layer leads to increased cloud droplet\nnumber concentration (CDNC), and assuming the cloud liquid\ncontent is unchanged, to increased cloud albedo. Exploitation of\nthis in geoengineering proposals involves regional-scale addition\nof sea-salt particles, in the range 0.8–4 µm diameter8–10, to\nmitigate global warming. However, such connections would\nrequire a monotonic relationship between sub-cloud CCN and\nCDNC which may not always be the case11,12.\nPrimary sea-salt and secondary sulfate aerosol can also become\nenriched in organics under conditions of high biological activity13,\nleading to quite complicated changes in the cloud droplet\nactivation properties. This is due to the diverse effects that\norganics can have on water uptake, which can inhibit or augment\ndroplet activation at a given supersaturation depending on the\nnature of the inorganic–organic chemical mixture14,15.\nApproaches to quantify the less complex scenario of the relative\ncontribution of sulfate and sea-salt to CCN have typically\nconcluded that non-sea-salt sulfate (nss-SO2\u0001\n4 ) dominates marine\nboundary layer CCN at higher supersaturations while sea-salt\ndominates at low supersaturations16–19. In this study, we aim to\nnot only quantify the first order effect of sea-salt addition (or\nsubtraction) to a sulfate-rich CCN population, but also to elucidate\nany possible higher order effects such as modification of the\nsupersaturation which can indirectly impact on the sulfate CCN\nconcentration.\nIn doing so, we apply a relatively novel technique to a suite of\nmeasurements and associated analysis of marine aerosol physico-\nchemical and CCN characteristics in the clean Southern Ocean/\nsub-Antarctic marine environment to quantify the number of sea-\nsalt and sulfate activated cloud droplets (as opposed to CCN\nspectra). CCN measurements are central to the analysis, as the\ndata gathered are used to generate critical supersaturation (Sc)\nversus critical dry diameter of activation (Dc) curves (or Sc–Dc\ncurves) of the ambient marine air.

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nShort-term precipitation events with high intensities govern the\ndynamics of numerous fast hydrological processes like flash\nfloods1 in urban areas and soil erosion2 in agriculture. It is\nexpected that precipitation events will intensify as a consequence\nof climate change. Recent studies focused on unravelling the\nrelationship between temperature and precipitation following the\nClausius–Clapeyron (CC) equation. This equation suggests that\nprecipitation extremes—more specifically the saturation vapour\npressure—increase by 7% per degree of warming3,4 or even\nexceed this rate at lower temporal scales (super CC-scaling)3,5–7.\nSince temperature–precipitation-scaling also shows decreasing\nrates above a certain temperature or dewpoint level, it is argued\nthat these scaling approaches are not valid under all possible\nconditions and thus they are not suitable for projecting changes in\nprecipitation extremes8. Moreover, trend analyses involving long-\nterm records of precipitation extremes are mostly in agreement\nwith these findings as two-thirds of stations worldwide showed\nincreasing trends9. Other studies found more stations with\nnegative than positive trends in summer precipitation extremes\nin Europe10.\nGlobal circulation models (GCMs) and regional climate models\n(RCMs) are capable of representing changes in precipitation\ncharacteristics at longer time scales (e.g., seasonal)6. Their\napplicability to reconstruct changes in sub-daily precipitation is\nviewed uncertain due to (i) validation data at sub-daily time scales\nwith sufficient record length is hardly available and the (ii) errors\nintroduced by applications of parameterization models outside\ntheir expected use. Parameterizations include e.g. convection\nprocesses6,11, which need to be considered for model grid\nspacings of more than ~5 km. Recent convection-resolving RCMs\nwith higher spatial resolution below ~5 km do not need such\nconvection parameterizations and thus are viewed promising for\nsimulating sub-daily rainfall6,11,12 even though they are still\nsubjected to uncertainties6,8. However, coarser scale GCM and\nRCM simulations are still capable to represent relevant character-\nistics of sub-daily precipitation (e.g., temperature–precipitation\nscaling, high-precipitation percentiles)3,13,14. They also reproduce\ntemporal changes and trends on decadal scales15. For climate\nprojections on the global scale convection parameterizations are\nstill relevant since convection-permitting models are demanding\nin terms of computational resources6,8.\nEven though the availability of long-term records of sub-daily\nprecipitation is very limited, uncertainties involved in modelling\nsub-daily rainfall extremes16 highlight the relevance of validating\nRCMs and GCMs in terms of their ability to predict sub-daily\nprecipitation and its sensitivity to climate variability and more\nspecifically climate change. Climate variability including both\nnatural climate variability and anthropogenic forcing affect\nchanges in precipitation extremes over time17, whereby natural\nclimate variability can mask the anthropogenic signal caused by\ngreenhouse gas emissions18. While long-term records of daily\nprecipitation are in general more readily available1,19 and reflect\nhigher evidence4,9,10,20, only a few studies focus on sub-daily\nprecipitation11,17,21. Transferring results from analyses involving\ndaily precipitation to smaller temporal scales is not reliable due to\nthe higher relevance of super CC-scaling especially at time scales\nbelow one day6.\nIn this study, we address the impediment to validate sub-daily\nprecipitation simulations under non-stationary conditions imposed\nby climate variability and climate change through compiling long-\nterm records of sub-hourly precipitation to provide a comprehen-\nsive dataset for model validation.

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nThe Equatorial Indian Ocean (EIO) is the second longest tropical\nocean belt after the tropical Pacific. EIO extending from 40°E to\n100°E and 10°S to 10°N has a great geographic, social, economic,\nand political importance. EIO plays an active role in global and\nregional climate change through ocean–atmosphere-coupled\nprocesses, and has a strong impact on many global and regional\nweather\nand\nclimate\npatterns1,\nincluding\nthe\nprecipitation\npatterns over the surrounding land mass2. The key feature of\nthe EIO is the strong air–sea interactions and the strong air–sea\ncoupling shows spatial and temporal variations from intraseasonal\nto interannual scales. The western and eastern EIO plays a key role\nin the formation of the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)3,4. It is well\nknown that El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has a global\nimpact on climate5; in particular, the wind anomalies associated\nwith ENSO extend up to the Indian Ocean, and in turn affect the\nbasin-wide circulation6. Saji et al.3 comprehensively described the\nIOD, and subsequent works recognized IOD and ENSO as the two\ndominant modes of interannual climate variability in the Indian\nOcean. IOD coupled with ENSO determines the strength of the\nIndian summer monsoon rainfall (ISMR)7–10. EIO also plays a key\nrole in exchanging heat by transporting warm waters from the\nPacific to the Indian Ocean through the Indonesian Through Flow,\nthereby hosting the largest pool of warm waters of the global\noceans11. The impact of IOD and ENSO on the Indian Ocean\ncirculation, particularly in the EIO, has also received substantial\nattention6.\nBeing an integral part of EIO, the Arabian Sea Mini Warm Pool12\nin the southeastern\nArabian\nSea, and the\nMadden Julian\nOscillation (MJO) in the central EIO, have pivotal implications on\nthe ISMR. Lower atmospheric and upper-ocean states over EIO\nsignificantly control the exchange of heat and momentum fluxes\nbetween the northern and southern Indian Ocean13. Equatorially\ntrapped\nsurface,\nsubsurface\ncurrents,\nand\ncounter\ncurrents\ncoupled with wind-forced Rossby waves and Kelvin waves over\nEIO are responsible for different physical regimes in the Indian\nOcean14. Strong Wyrtki jet over the western and eastern EIO\nduring pre- and post monsoon, respectively, uplifts the thermo-\ncline at the west and sinks the thermocline at its eastern terminus,\nthus causing changes in the water mass structure in the EIO15.\nThe EIO acts as a bridge between the southern and the northern\nIndian Ocean (as well as the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal) in\nexchanging the waters through advection, thereby changing\nwater properties (density and temperature) of these basins. Thus,\nthe EIO shows both negative and positive feedbacks through\nstrong coupling with the atmosphere. Both these feedbacks show\ntemporal and spatial variations through remote and local forcing,\nand indeed affect the regional and global weather patterns16,17.\nIOD and MJO are some of the ocean–atmosphere-coupled\nphenomena affected by variations in these forcing and feedback\nmechanisms, and thus induce significant changes in the tropical\nweather patterns. North–South subsurface dipole is another mode\nof variability observed in the tropical Indian Ocean, caused by\nsubsurface temperature change and resembling the patterns of\nIOD (both phases) and El Niño co-occurrence years18. Cloud cover,\nwinds, radiation fluxes, precipitation, and evaporation are the\natmospheric parameters that influence the EIO19,20. Surface and\nsubsurface ocean currents, turbulent fluxes, and heat transfer due\nto advection are the oceanic processes guiding the dynamics of\nthe EIO21. Both weather and climate anomalies coupled with\nchanges in upper- ocean dynamics and the lower atmosphere\nhave a strong impact on the Indian Ocean rim countries. Hence,\npresently there is a strong focus on understanding the dynamics\nof EIO in more detail by the weather and climate forecasting\ncommunity.\nA direct measure to know the upper-ocean variability is to stu\n\n[TRUNCATED]",

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nAtmospheric aerosols constitute a major human health concern\nand impact Earth’s radiative balance both directly and indirectly\nthrough their influence on cloud properties. Atmospheric aerosols\nact as cloud condensation nuclei, thus altering cloud albedo,\nstructure, and lifetime. They also represent a major health and\neconomic\nissue,\nas\nparticulate\npollution\nis\nresponsible\nfor\napproximately three million premature deaths per year, which is\nprojected to increase to six million by 20501. Volatile organic\ncompounds (VOCs), emitted into the atmosphere from anthro-\npogenic and biogenic sources, are major players in atmospheric\nphotochemical reactions that contribute to ozone formation. VOCs\nare also responsible for secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation\nin the presence of photo-oxidants2.\nAs revealed by different model simulations and laboratory\nstudies, the most important source of atmospheric aerosols, in\nterms of the number concentration and proportion of climate-\nrelevant particles, is new particle formation (NPF) and growth3.\nHowever, the nucleation mechanism leading to NPF remains\npoorly understood. Sulfuric acid has been identified as a key\ncompound in atmospheric NPF4; however, its concentration in the\natmosphere is too low to explain the observed nucleation rates, so\nadditional compounds need to be identified4. Base compounds\nsuch as ammonia5 or amines6 have been proven to stabilize\nsulfuric acid clusters, leading to nucleation rates similar to those\nobserved in the atmosphere. In addition, highly oxygenated\nmolecules (HOMs) coming from the oxidation of VOCs can also\nstabilize sulfuric acid clusters7, and a recent study8 found that\nHOMs are able to form particles without the participation of\nsulfuric acid.\nThe\nformation\nof\nthese\ncompounds\nfrom\nozonolysis\nof\nmonoterpenes has been quantified9, and modeling studies have\nquantified their formation in the atmosphere and their role in air\nquality10,11. However, our understanding of the processes involved\nin the formation and ageing of organic aerosols remains very\nlimited but entirely necessary to improve the robustness of the\nmodels12.\nIt is now well-known that agriculture and its activities affect\nlocal, regional, and global air quality, and global climate via not\nonly significant ammonia (NH3) and greenhouse gas (GHG)\nemissions but also VOC and aerosol emissions13. In some regions\n(e.g., eastern USA, Europe, Russia, and East Asia), agricultural\nemissions are estimated to be the largest relative contribution to\nPM2.5\n14. Agriculture also represents a major ground-level ozone\nsink15. A wide variety of pollutants and GHGs, especially nitrogen-\ncontaining compounds, are emitted to the atmosphere from\nagricultural activities, including fertilizer use, farm machinery\noperation and livestock manure spreading. In particular, in France,\nagriculture is estimated to generate approximately one-third of\nthe annual particle emissions (e.g., from livestock housing and\ntilling activities), but this estimate remains highly uncertain16.\nWhile great efforts have been made to estimate GHG and NH3\nemissions from agriculture and explore ways to abate them,\nknowledge about other pollutants, particularly SOA and VOC\nprecursors, emitted by this sector is still scarce. Agricultural\nactivities involving fertilizers or pesticides are also known to emit\nVOCs with high SOA formation potential14. However, the current\nknowledge mainly considers the effect of ammonia on PM\nformation. A recent study,17 testing scenarios of agricultural\nemissions reductions, showed that in many densely populated\nareas, PM2.5 aerosols formed from gases released by fertilizer\napplication and animal husbandry can dominate over the\ncombined contributions from all other anthropogenic pollution.\nThe authors showed that the impact of livestock and fertilizers on\n1UMR ECOSYS, INRAE, AgroParisTech, Université Paris-Saclay, 78850 Thiverval-Grignon, France. 2Univ.

    "abstract": "The impacts of the atmospheric boundary layer on regional\nhaze in North China\nQianhui Li1, Hongsheng Zhang\n1✉, Xuhui Cai2, Yu Song2 and Tong Zhu2\nAn intensive atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) experiment was conducted simultaneously at six stations arranged in a cross shape on\nthe North China Plain (NCP) from 26 November to 26 December 2019. The impacts of the regional ABL structure on heavy haze pollution\nand the relationship between the ABL height and aerosol accumulation layer (AAL) depth were discussed. Bouts of downdrafts generate\na persistent descending elevated inversion layer, helping the maintenance and exacerbation of haze pollution. Continuous weak wind\nlayers contribute to the pollutants accumulation, and low-level jets promote the removal of air pollutants. The unique landform\nconditions of the NCP are reflected in its regional ABL structure and further affect the spatial distribution of haze pollution. Due to the\ndrainage flow and strong downdrafts, the western stations near the mountains have a colder surface and warmer upper air masses,\nresulting in a more stable stratification and worse diffusion conditions; these stations also experience a thicker weak wind layer caused by\nincreased friction. Thus, the spatial distribution of haze is heavier in the west and lighter in the east. The convective boundary layer (CBL)\nheight declines evidently during haze episodes, usually lower than 560 m. Furthermore, as the vertical distribution of aerosols is mainly\ninfluenced by daytime thermal turbulence and maintained at night, it is appropriate to determine the CBL height using the AAL depth.\nHowever, the AAL depth is not consistent with the stable boundary layer height due to the influence of the residual layer at night.",
    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nFrequent haze pollution events represent one of the most serious\natmospheric environmental problems faced by China, as they\nresult in poor air quality and low visibility1–3. Fine particulate\nmatter, known as PM2:5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic\ndiameter no greater than 2.5 μm), is the chief pollutant4,5. Haze\npollution shows considerable seasonal variations and regional\ndisparities. Seasonally, it is generally more serious in winter6,7.\nSpatially, the North China Plain (NCP), the Yangtze River Delta\n(YRD), the Pearl River Delta (PRD), and the Sichuan Basin (SB) have\nbeen recognized as four major haze regions in China8–11. The NCP\nhas become the most polluted district in China12. And the effects\nof its unique topography and local circulation on haze pollution in\nthe NCP have attracted wide attention of researchers13–19.\nThe formation mechanisms of long-lasting winter haze pollution\nevents characterized by high PM2:5 concentrations have been\ninvestigated from various perspectives and on different scales20–24.\nIn general, persistent heavy haze events are associated with a high\nemission background25,26, adverse meteorological conditions27–30,\nregional transport31–33, and secondary aerosol formation34–36. In\nparticular,\nthe\nmeteorological\nconditions\nin\nthe\natmospheric\nboundary layer (ABL), which determines the vertical transport of\nheat, water vapor and aerosols between the underlying surface and\natmosphere, are crucial to haze dispersion37. Strong inversions and\nstagnant winds are favorable conditions for the accumulation of\npollutants, and high humidity can contribute to the hygroscopic\ngrowth and secondary formation of aerosols38,39. The diurnal\nvariation of the ABL can result in variations in the PM2:5\nconcentration40,41. In the daytime ABL, known as the convective\nboundary layer (CBL), PM2:5 can be mixed uniformly in a thick layer\ndue to the active turbulent mixing42. While in the nighttime ABL, also\ncalled the stable boundary layer (SBL), high PM2:5 concentrations are\noften observed near the surface due to the stable stratification and\nintermittent turbulence43–45. Moreover, pollutants in the residual\nlayer can be mixed downward to the surface with the development\nof the ABL the next morning16,46,47. Regarding the dynamic structure,\nlow-level jets (LLJs) and turbulent motions can modify the air quality\nby affecting transport and diffusion capabilities. LLJs can not only\ncontribute to the advection of pollutants to less polluted areas48,\nbut also improve air quality in the pollution dissipation stage\nby\ntriggering\nturbulent\nmixing\nand\ntransferring\nmomentum\ndownward49,50.\nThe atmospheric boundary layer height (ABLH) is an important\nparameter in air quality assessments that reflects the effects of\nturbulent mixing, convection and other physical processes in the\nABL51. Studies have shown that the ABLH is a main meteorological\ndriver of PM2:5 variation52. There is a negative correlation between\nthe ABLH and pollutant concentrations53–55. The ABLH in winter is\nlower than that in summer, which makes haze pollution form\nmore easily in winter56,57. In addition, with the rapid development\nof ground-based remote sensing equipment, such as lidars and\nceilometers, a number of studies have attempted to retrieve the\nABLH\nbased\non\nthe\ndistributions\nof\nsubstances58–60.\nThe\ntheoretical basis of this approach is that aerosols are abundant\nin the ABL, but sharply decrease at the boundary layer top, while\nthe free atmosphere is free of aerosols61.\nWith the increasing attention paid to the impacts of the ABL on\nhaze pollution, many field experiments have been conducted.\nAtmospheric profiles have commonly been acquired by meteor-\nological towers, tethered balloons, conventional radiosondes and\nsurface-based\nremote\nsensing\nequipment47,62–65.\nHowever,\nboundary layer observations are still scarce overall, the influence\nof the ABL structure on heavy haze pollution remains to be\nstudied.

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nThe classic Rayleigh–Bénard convection1,2 describes a fluid flow\nbetween two plates due to a uniform temperature gradient\n(heated from below). Gradual increase in the thermal forcing\ninitially drives 2D roll pattern formation2 or 3D hexagons3, which\ncan then evolve into time-dependent flow, and finally into\nturbulent convection4. These dynamics are recognized in the\natmosphere, especially over the ocean, by certain roll-like and\nhexagonal cloud patterns5–7. In the subtropical marine atmo-\nsphere, for example, heat from the ocean surface (the warmer\nplate) is transferred by convection to the boundary layer top (the\ncolder upper plate), and shallow clouds organize into cloud streets\n(rolls and linear clouds) or cellular patterns (marine stratocumulus,\nMSc) that generate hexagonal shapes in their ideal form8. These\nclouds cover large oceanic regions, and have a significant effect\non the earth’s albedo and the transfer of heat, moisture and\nmomentum in the lower atmosphere9,10. Cellular patterns of\nclouds can appear as closed or as open cells. Updraft that forms at\nthe central part of the closed cell creates shallow clouds with large\ncoverage, whereas for open cells the updraft forms along the cell’s\nwalls, yielding thicker clouds with lower cloud coverage11.\nAlthough the general patterns of the Rayleigh-Bénard convec-\ntion can provide a first-approximation description of cloud\npatterns, it is far too simple to capture the full complexity of\ncellular clouds’ convection. A cloud field system is controlled by\ninteractions and competitions between thermodynamic, radiative,\nand microphysical processes, and therefore forms a much richer\nphysical system. For example, in MSc cloud fields the air mass\nproperties and the boundary conditions are non-uniform9,12. The\npresence of the clouds in the system dictates a two-phase (at\nleast)\nproblem,\nincluding\nadditional\ncloud\nprocesses13\nand\ninteractions with ambient meteorological conditions14.\nThe complexity of the cloud system leads to some discrepancies\nbetween the classical Rayleigh–Bénard theory and observations.\nFor example, previous measurements of MSc cells reported a\ntypical aspect ratio (diameter divided by depth) of ~206,8, while\nthe theoretical value for Rayleigh–Bénard cells is between 1 and\n39. Other studies highlighted the crucial role of rain in impacting\nthe dynamic and thermodynamic conditions, and hence the\norganization and evolution of MSc cells. For example, the\nevaporation of raindrops below cloud base generates a dynamic\nresponse of cellular organization of updrafts and downdrafts that\npromotes the formation of open cells15. Therefore, rain produced\ndowndrafts, can open closed cells by flipping their dynamic\ncirculation16–18. Other studies showed that precipitating MSc cells\noscillate with an average periodicity of ~3 h, while closed ones\n(which don’t precipitate) do not oscillate, and can maintain a\nsteady structure for much longer17,19. On the other hand, there\nwere studies that suggested that cold pool dynamic forcing is not\nessential for the organization of a cloud layer20,21.\nDifferently from shallow MSc cells (top at 1–2 km), there are\nopen cells that form under deeper convection conditions (refer\nhereafter as “deep-open-cells”, up to ~5–7 km). One example,\nwhich was rarely investigated, is deep-open-cells within the cold\npost-frontal sector of winter Mediterranean cyclones. Rosenfeld\nobserved that these deep-open-cells are common within Cyprus\nlows (Mediterranean cyclones centered near Cyprus)22. Other\nstudies that explored other areas around the global (like the\nnortheast gulf of Alaska) revealed that similar deep-open-cells\n(cloud top up to ~5.5 km) are mostly a cold-season phenom-\nenon23, usually produce significant precipitation24, and are linked\nto squall-like patterns of the surface winds25.

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nHigh surface ozone (O3) concentrations pose a serious concern for\nmodern societies because they have been associated with\ndeleterious effects on human health1,2, damage to crops3,4 and\nclimate change5,6. Reversing the impacts of anthropogenic air\npollution demands actions aimed at reducing dependency on\nfossil fuel in the transport, industry and energy sectors7,8. As a\nresult of attempts to reduce that dependency, limit emissions of\ngreenhouse gases and lower ambient concentrations of atmo-\nspheric pollutants, the global consumption of biofuels, such as\nethanol, has doubled in the last two decades9.\nBy 2019, the participation of ethanol (hydrated and anhydrous)\nin the matrix of fuels used by Otto cycle engines (in passenger cars\nand other light-duty vehicles) in Brazil reached 48.3%10. Brazil is\nthe second largest ethanol producer in the world11, and the state\nof São Paulo accounts for 55% of the sugarcane production in the\ncountry12, sugarcane occupying 70% of the land devoted to\nagriculture in the state (Fig. 1).\nIn the past, controlled burning of sugarcane fields was\nresponsible for considerable emissions of gases and particles;\ngovernment actions have limited that practice, leading to lower air\npollutant emissions in the state13. However, the material known as\nbagasse (sugarcane leaves/sheaths) is used as fuel in electric\npower plants, which are sources of atmospheric pollutants14,15,\ngenerating emissions throughout the year. Paradoxically, the rural\nregions of the state play an important role in improving air quality\nin the large urban centres by providing cleaner fuels. Rural areas\nmay be affected by pollution from biofuel production, as well as\nreceiving air pollutants by regional transport from urban centres.\nUnfortunately, without sufficient air pollutant monitoring data, the\nimportant role that the transition from fossil fuel to biofuels can\nplay in mitigating the impacts on climate and health cannot be\nfully understood. One limitation of previous studies is the paucity\nof data for rural areas, which hinders the evaluation of the\ndistribution of air pollutants, especially O3, on a regional scale.\nO3 is a short-lived climate pollutant (SLCP), with an atmospheric\nlifetime of ~23 days16, hence it can be transported to other\nregions. The most important contributors to anthropogenic\nclimate change, after CO2, are methane, hydrofluorocarbon, black\ncarbon and O3\n17. Although several recent studies have addressed\nO3 concentrations at sites within the fourth largest megacity in the\nworld—the metropolitan area of São Paulo (MASP)18—and in\nurban areas of the state of São Paulo19–26, none performed an in-\ndepth analysis of the regional effects that emissions from the\nMASP and the transport of gases from biomass burning have on\nO3 concentrations. Long-range transport of O3 is seen in other\nparts of the world. For example, Doherty27 and Lin et al.28 showed\nthe intercontinental transport of O3 from East Asia to western\nNorth America and the flow of O3-rich air from Eurasia toward\nHawaii, based on long-term measurements performed at Mauna\nLoa observatory. There is also evidence that regional O3 (averaged\nover large areas extending well beyond cities) is increasing at\nsome locations, particularly in densely populated areas, as pointed\nout by Madronich et al.29 who found a 6–7% increase per decade\nin the Indo-Gangetic Plains, as well as in Beijing during the 2008\nSummer Olympics. In Brazil, Boian and Andrade30 using the\nCaltech–Carnegie Mellon 3-D Eulerian photochemical model (CIT)\nshowed the transport of O3 from the MASP to the city of\nCampinas, 90 km to the northwest. The surface measurements\nshowed a second peak of O3 that the modelling showed to be due\nto the transport of O3 and O3 precursors from the MASP to that\nlocation.\nIn recent years, air pollutant emissions from thermal power\nplants have increased because of greater demand, bagasse-fired\npower plants generating ~25% of the energy produced in the\nstate of São Pa\n\n[TRUNCATED]",

Particle growth factor is also considered as a vital\nparameter in determining the deposition of aerosols in the human\nrespiratory system2,7,8 as atmospheric aerosols at 200 nm can\ngrow their size to more than double when exposed to a high\nrelative humidity (>99.5%) in the human lung, enhancing their\nlung deposition efficiencies.\nHygroscopic properties of aerosols can be described by\nhygroscopic Gf that are commonly measured by a hygroscopicity\ntandem differential mobility analyser (HTDMA) instrument1. The Gf\nis defined as the ratio between the particle diameter measured at\na high relative humidity (RH) condition (dw, RH~ 90%) and a dry\nparticle diameter measured at a low RH condition (dp, RH < 10%):\nGf RH\nð\nÞ ¼\ndwðRHÞ\ndpðRH < 10%Þ\n(1)\nThe values of Gf have been widely used to classify hygroscopic\nproperties of aerosols into four groups: nearly-hydrophobic\n(Gf ~<1.11), less-hygroscopic (Gf ~1.11–1.33), more-hygroscopic\n(Gf ~1.33–1.85) and sea-salt aerosols (Gf ~>1.85)1. HTDMA\ntechniques are now used extensively to characterise hygroscopic\nproperties of atmospheric aerosols in different environments,\nincluding rural, marine, remote, urban background, and roadside\nareas2. However, there are some disadvantages of HTDMA\nmeasurements: (1) a HTDMA instrument can only measure particle\ngrowth factors for several selected diameters in a limited size\nrange (30–350 nm); (2) the measurement does not have high time\nresolution; (3) possible bias if equilibrium conditions are not\nadequately reflected8; and (4) the effect of condensed vapours on\nthe surface of measured particles creating internally mixed\nparticles and error in the HTDMA measurements8–10.\nParticles released from different sources have different chemical\ncomposition and sizes that determine their different hygroscopic\nproperties. Vu et al.2 reviewed the Gf of particles from three\nsources, including traffic emissions, biomass burning and nuclea-\ntion, and found that fresh combustion-generated aerosols are\npredominantly nearly-hydrophobic or less-hygroscopic particles.\nDuring the atmospheric aging process, aerosols can be subjected\nto other aerosol dynamical processes which may change their\nshape and chemical composition, leading to a change in their\nhygroscopic properties. Kotchenruther and Hobbs11 found higher\ngrowth factors of aged wood smoke aerosols (1.3–1.5) than those\nof fresh wood smoke aerosol (1.1–1.3). Aerosols emitted from\ntraffic sources have sometimes been observed to increase their\nhygroscopic growth factor during atmospheric ageing, but this\nincrement was much lower than that of biomass burning\naerosols12. McMeeking et al.13 used a HTDMA coupled with a\nsingle-particle soot photometer (HTDMA-SP2) system to measure\nthe refractory black carbon (rBC) aerosol hygroscopicity and found\nan influence of mixed rBC on the hygroscopic properties of\naerosols. Despite a considerable number of HTDMA measure-\nments for ambient aerosols in recent years, there are a few\nmodelling studies on hygroscopic properties of aerosols from\nsources such as coal combustion or secondary organic aerosols.\nHygroscopic growth is affected by both the inherent hygro-\nscopicity of the material comprising the particle, and for smaller\nparticles (<100 nm) by the influence of the Kelvin Effect upon\nvapour \n\n[TRUNCATED]",

Over the past century, the\nsoutheastern\nU.S.\nhas\nincreasingly\nrecorded\nmore\nextreme\nprecipitation events1. Since 1910, much of the U.S. has received\na greater proportion of its total precipitation from intense one-day\nrainfall events2. During 1958–2016, there was a 27% increase in\nthe 99th percentile precipitation3 in the southeastern U.S. During\n1949–2018, TCs comprised 25 of the top 100, 4-day rainfall events\nnationwide4; with one-quarter of the top 100 events occurring in\nthe final decade of the 70-yr record, at a far greater frequency\nthan in any other decade. Throughout the mid-latitudes, extreme\nrainfall events will likely become more intense in a warmer world\nfrom increased tropospheric water vapor5. The 20-yr return value\nof the annual maximum daily rainfall—a measure often used in\nurban planning—could increase by an average of 5.3% °C−1\nwarming with wide regional variability6. TC precipitation will likely\nincrease globally, and a 2 °C warming could increase the median\nTC precipitation rate by 14% at constant relative humidity7.\nEastern North Carolina (ENC, Fig. 1) is among the most\nvulnerable regions for TC impacts in the U.S. Since 1886, over\n160 TCs have passed within 500 km of the North Carolina coast,\nwith a TC crossing the state every 2–3 years8. Additionally, the\ncoastal plains of ENC have a limited elevation range, enhancing its\nvulnerability to prolonged flooding9. Since 1999, Hurricanes Floyd,\nMatthew, and Florence set record rainfall and discharges in ENC\nriver basins4,10 (Fig. 1), resulting in historic flooding.\nGlobal mean TC wind speeds, precipitation rates, and intensity\nare projected to increase by the late twenty-first century7,11,12,\nwhich underscores the need to examine how the most devastat-\ning storms in ENC may be enhanced by climate change. Recent\nextreme rainfall events illustrate that rainfall probability statistics\nbased on stationarity assumptions can no longer represent the\nrapidly changing climate10,13,14.\nTo explore changes in extreme rainfall at ‘2100’, the Design-\nRainfall Approach (DRA) is proposed, where observed rainfall\nstatistics are adjusted for changes in probability statistics derived\nfrom the dynamically downscaled global climate models (GCMs).\nHere, we do not explicitly model future hurricanes; rather, we\nexamine potential changes in storm total precipitation informed\nby projections of future climatic conditions.

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nGroundbreaking work over the last several years demonstrates\nthat climate models can predict the North Atlantic Oscillation\n(NAO) out to near-decadal timescales1–4. The key insight offered\nby Smith et al. (2020; henceforth S20) is that decadal predictive\nskill for the NAO only emerges in very large multi-model\nensembles4. Their team, scattered across the most advanced\nweather and climate modeling centers in the world, built a\nforecast system composed of decade-long runs of 169 ensemble\nmembers across 46 start dates. Even with over 77,000 model-years\nof output at their disposal, S20 still required post-processing to\novercome the unrealistically low signal-to-noise ratio in climate\nmodels, tantalizingly termed the “signal-to-noise paradox”5,6. In\nthis paper, we will build on S20 by analyzing and improving our\nunderstanding of the predictable component of the NAO in an\nuninitialized very large ensemble.\nA successful prediction of the NAO from the ensemble mean of\nan initialized forecast system suggests that NAO predictability is\ncomposed of two components in yet unknown proportions: one\nfrom ocean initialization and another from external forcing7. All\nclimate model runs require both initial conditions and boundary\nconditions. Researchers who run initialized forecast systems\nprescribe initial conditions that are designed to approximate the\nobserved state of the climate at the time the forecast is initiated.\nRecent literature refers to the act of using an observationally\nbased initial state as “initialization”. In the initialized hindcasts of\nS20, consistent with much of the decadal prediction literature, as\nthe model integrates it incorporates estimates of observed\nexternal radiative forcing. The uninitialized ensembles used here\neschew the incorporation of data from observations into their\ninitial conditions but are forced by the same time history of\nexternal forcing. Averaging across a large ensemble effectively\nremoves the uncorrelated, internally generated variability and\nretains the information common to all ensemble members. As\nabove, the ensemble mean of an initialized prediction system\nisolates information from ocean initialization and external forcing.\nThe ensemble mean of an uninitialized ensemble reflects the\nisolated influence of external forcing.\nA careful comparison of initialized forecast systems and\nuninitialized ensembles can therefore reveal the value of ocean\ninitialization. Analysis of the best available initialized forecast\nsystems claims, at a minimum, regional improvements from\ninitialization in upper ocean temperature, SST, precipitation, and\nsurface pressure7,8. In particular, ocean temperature in parts of the\nNorth Atlantic subpolar gyre seems to have more predictive skill\nthan the surrounding ocean in initialized models and that skill\nappears to be tied to the ocean circulation8–14. Ocean tempera-\ntures may influence the NAO15–18, so it is plausible that ocean\ninitialization could improve skill in predicting the NAO.\nThere are hints that external forcing can be a source of\npredictive skill for the NAO at longer lead times. In both models\nand observations, tropical volcanic eruptions instigate the NAO to\nmove towards its positive phase19,20. In the mid-20th century,\nthere is a linear trend in the NAO index and this trend is one\ncomponent of predictive skill in the NAO (compare Athanasiadis\net al. 2020s Figs. 2c and 6c)1. In addition, on decadal timescales, in\nthe Community Earth System Model (CESM), an uninitialized\nensemble\nproduces\nskill\ncommensurate\nwith\nan\ninitialized\nprediction system for two NAO impacts: North American and\nwestern European summertime precipitation (as estimated via\nfield significance in Yeager et al. 2018s Fig. 5)8.\nUsing a 269-member uninitialized multi-model large ensemble,\nin this paper we show that external forcing is the larger\ncomponent of NAO predictability. In the Methods section, we\nprovide further details of this ensemble and the methods we\nemploy to study it.\n\n[TRUNCATED]",

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nOver recent decades, the Earth’s average surface air temperature\nhas warmed at a rate of ~0.2 °C decade−1 1. This warming is\nunevenly distributed across the planet with the Arctic generally\nwarming at a much quicker rate; a phenomenon referred to as\nArctic amplification2. Arctic amplification is particularly pro-\nnounced\nduring\nthe\nwinter months,\nwith winter\nwarming\nexceeding that of the summer by nearly a factor of four3.\nHowever, the enhanced warming rates in winter are largely linked\nto changes in sea ice extent (SIE), a process that is strongly\ninfluenced by the summer climate4–10.\nDecreased SIE during the summer and fall seasons allows the\nArctic Ocean to absorb more solar radiation and increase the\nocean heat content9,11,12. This accumulation of heat during non-\nwinter months enhances winter Arctic amplification in two ways.\nFirst, it limits the pace of sea ice growth in winter, resulting in a\ngreater transfer of ocean heat to the lower atmosphere9. Second,\nthe lack of SIE enhances oceanic evaporation, increasing the\namount of water vapor in the atmosphere13,14. Increases in water\nvapor have been directly linked to increased downwelling\nlongwave (LW) flux which increases air temperatures and can\nfurther limit winter sea ice growth in a positive water vapor\nfeedback process14. Consequently, identifying the mechanisms\nthat lead to enhanced sea ice loss during the summer is important\nnot only for summer Arctic warming, but also for winter-time\nArctic amplification.\nSummer Arctic near-surface temperatures and SIE are strongly\ninfluenced by the presence of water vapor and subsequent\ndownward longwave fluxes15. Understanding the sources of\nsummer moisture and their variability for the Arctic is therefore\ncritical for the attribution and prediction of Arctic warming\npatterns. Several studies have attempted to identify the sources of\nArctic moisture using Eulerian approaches. Strong moisture\ntransport from the North Atlantic and North Pacific is shown in\nJakobson, Vihma16 with much weaker moisture transport coming\nfrom land masses. Strong poleward moisture flux from the Pacific\nwas also found in Dulfour et al.17, while Luo et al.18 found the\nNorth Atlantic to be the strongest source of poleward moisture\nflux. Though Eulerian approaches have been widely used,\nLagrangian techniques are better suited to determine where\natmospheric vapor originated from since they are able to specify\nevaporation source regions19.\nOne popular Lagrangian technique is the use of back-trajectory\nanalysis methods. Several studies have attempted to identify the\nsources of Arctic moisture using back-trajectories and reanalysis\ndata. Some studies find that atmospheric moisture transport from\nlower latitude oceanic regions is the dominant source of moisture\nfor the Arctic20, while others find the continental regions, namely\nNorth America, to dominate summer vapor21. While these studies\nprovide a first-order approximation of the sources of summer\nArctic moisture, their reliance on back-trajectory analysis methods,\nwhich involve an oversimplification of the model physics including\na lack of vertical precipitative fluxes, turbulent transfer, and low\ntemporal resolution, potentially biases their estimations of the\nmagnitude and location of moisture sources22. Additionally, these\nstudies find conflicting contributions of the land surface to Arctic\nmoisture, which warrants further investigation given rapidly\nchanging land surface characteristics across the globe23,24.\nHere, we utilize a climate model with online water tracking\ncapabilities to examine the relative roles of different terrestrial and\noceanic regions in shaping summer Arctic vapor totals. Our results\nhighlight the key role of the mid-and high-latitude land surface in\ndriving summer Arctic vapor concentrations and the subsequent\nArctic warming.

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nNear-term decadal climate predictions represent an important\nsource of information with the potential to support decision-\nmaking and strengthen the resilience of a wide range of socio-\neconomic sectors that are heavily influenced by climate variability,\nchange, and extremes1. For example, agriculture and climate-\nsensitive energy sectors, such as hydroelectricity, wind, and solar\nenergies, can greatly benefit from this type of information2,3.\nHowever, up to now, only a few studies4–7 have explored the\nusability of these readily available near-term decadal climate\nforecasts for specific sectoral needs.\nThe entire agricultural sector (food-producing systems, markets,\netc.) is influenced by climate variability, unfavorable weather, and\nclimate extremes (e.g., droughts and heatwaves8,9). In this context,\nclimate risk management10 for capacity adaptation, planning, risk-\nmitigation, and early response to climate extremes can benefit\nfrom decadal climate predictions. The advantage of using these\npredictions compared to climate projections\nrelies on the\ntemporal coherence of the main large scale climate patterns with\nobservations11 and the possibility to assess their quality by\nevaluating the performance of retrospective decadal predictions\nagainst observations over the recent historical period1. The latter\naspect facilitates a retrospective risk assessment of recent past\ndroughts and heatwaves relevant for the agricultural sector,\nimproving the communication of the risks associated with those\nextreme events for informed decision-making.\nClimate information at decadal timescale holds the potential for\nbeing of great value for a broad range of users in the agricultural\nsector, especially in its producing component, who are affected by\nclimate variability and who would benefit from additional sources\nof information. Wheat is the most harvested cereal crop in the\nworld (harvested area in 2019; contributing\nto the local food security of many countries. Unfavorable\nconditions and extreme weather such as heat or water stress\naffect both grain yield and quality, especially when they occur in\nthe most sensitive development stages of the plant12,13. For\ninstance, heat stress occurring during the flowering stage affects\nfloret fertility causing a reduction of the grain number14, whereas\nheat stress that occurs during the grain filling stage reduces grain\nquality and size15. Similarly, drought conditions can affect either\ngrain number, when the stress occurs before or during the\nflowering stage, or grain size, when the drought occurs after the\nflowering stage due to its impact on grain filling16.\nIn the framework of the EU H2020-MED-GOLD project, the\ndurum wheat community has been engaged in the co-design of\ninnovative sectoral climate services based on specific users’ needs\nand opportunities. This process has revealed some key decision\nareas that could be improved by having reliable decadal climate\ninformation available well in advance, such as risk estimates for\nthe global market, investments in agro-management infrastruc-\nture and tools, planning of supply chain contracts or targeted\nbreeding programmes3. Strategic tools in policies such as the EU\nCommon Agricultural Policy, designed to address EU climate\nambition, may also benefit from initialized decadal climate\npredictions.\nRecent advances in the understanding and forecasting of the\nclimate have resulted in skillful decadal climate predictions1,11,17.\nNevertheless, for the provision of an end-to-end climate service\nfocused on some of the above-mentioned specific needs of the\nwheat sector, efforts are still needed to convert available climate\npredictions into usable information by users.

Recent analysis of the direct\neconomic losses as a result of convective events suggests that\nover Europe and North America altogether, around 300 billion\nUSD in damage has been reported over the last decade1.\nThunderstorms produce a variety of hazards that lead to fatalities,\nincluding heavy precipitation with flash flooding2, lightning3, large\nhail4, damaging winds5 and tornadoes6. As direct observations of\nmany of these phenomena are sparse, a typical approach has\nbeen to identify key ingredients necessary to their formation7, and\nuse them as a proxy for assessing climatological frequency and\nintensity of severe convective storms, a technique well validated\nby observations8–10.

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nAgricultural production has been increasingly exposed to unfavor-\nable climate events and extremes in the last decades1,2. Examples\nof such extremes are heat stress, drought, and excessive rainfall3.\nThese events can lead to heavy reductions in, and even failures of,\ncrop yield quantity and quality4, with potential regional-to-global\nconsequences in the agricultural markets and trade patterns5.\nClimate change is projected to further exacerbate this tendency.\nThe resilience of the agricultural sector can be enhanced by\ndeveloping and implementing dedicated sectoral climate services\nto reduce risks but also seize the opportunities given by tailored\nclimate information.

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nBlack carbon (BC) is an important aerosol component and is\nprimarily emitted from fossil fuel combustion and wood burning.\nBC has strong absorption of light from ultraviolet to near-infrared\nwavelengths1 and it contributes to global warming, following\nCO22–4. Adverse impacts of BC on regional air quality5,6 and\nhuman health7–9 have been widely reported. Considering its short\natmospheric lifetime (4–12 days)10–12, reducing BC emissions\nwould\nhave\nsynergistic\nbenefits\nagainst\nits\nwarming13,\nair\npollution14, and adverse human health effects8,9. For reducing\nBC emissions, it is important to quantify the contributions of its\nvarious sources.\nThere are five methods to apportion the BC sources including\nreceptor model, radiocarbon method, Marco-tracer, air quality\nmodeling, and the Aethalometer method. The key strengths and\nweaknesses of these common BC source apportionment methods\nare summarized elsewhere15. Among these methods, the Aethal-\nometer model has the advantages of high temporal resolution\nand is easy to be operated16. Therefore, it has been widely\nadopted in BC source apportionment studies16–22. This method\nuses the aerosol light absorption at two wavelengths to apportion\nthe equivalent BC (eBC) into fossil fuel combustion-related eBC\n(eBCff) and wood burning-related eBC (eBCwb)16. The accuracy of\nthe Aethalometer model results is mainly dependent on the\nabsorption Ångström exponent (α) for fossil fuel combustion (αff)\nand wood burning (αwb). Previous studies always applied fixed α\nvalues in the Aethalometer model17,22–27. However, αff and αwb\nvaried in the ranges of 0.9–1.128,29 and 0.9–3.530–32, respectively,\ndetermined by combustion efficiency33, mixing state of aerosol\ncomponents33–35, aerosol size36, and chemical composition37. It is\nproblematic to use fixed α values in the Aethalometer model.\nPrevious studies also showed spatial heterogeneity in the optimal\ncombination of αff and αwb. αff = 0.90 and αwb = 1.68 were\nrecommended in Switzerland38. αff = 1.10 and αwb = 1.60 were\nadopted in Helsinki of Finland21. A combination of αff = 0.90 and\nαwb = 1.82 was reported in metropolitan Milan, Italy39. The optimal\nαff and αwb were reported in the ranges of 0.97–1.12 and\n1.63–1.74, respectively, in the urban and rural areas of Spain40.\nTherefore, the determination of site-specific αff and αwb is essential\nprior to using the Aethalometer model.\nTo get the site-specific αff and αwb, previous studies used\nauxiliary measurements such as radiocarbon (14C)16,38,39,41 and\nlevoglucosan (LG)20,21,40,42. 14C is an ideal tool to distinguish BC\nfrom the combustion of contemporary carbon and fossil fuel43.\nThe constraint using 14C can precisely obtain the optimal αff and\nαwb38,39. The attribution using 14C still has some issues such as\nsample contamination, improvement in instrument analysis, and\nthe separation of organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon\n(EC)43. These issues inevitably introduce uncertainty to the source\napportionment result. Constraint using the linear regression\nbetween LG and eBCwb can calculate the optimal αff, while the\noptimal αwb value is empirically chosen. The usage of LG to get the\noptimal α combination also has shortages. LG undergoes chemical\ndegradation from the source to receptor44–46 and it has other\nsources such as coal combustion47,48, cooking emission49, and\ngarbage burning50, etc. These sources would result in an\noverestimated contribution of wood burning to BC. Additionally,\nprevious studies with 14C or LG to find the optimal α values were\nlow in temporal resolution, which was determined by the\nsampling duration (i.e., >23 h)51. However, the BC emission\nsources showed obvious diurnal variations, which suggested that\nthe previous studies with the 14C and LG constraints failed to\ndescribe the dynamic variations of optimal α values within a day.\nTherefore, a wood burning tracer with properties of chemical\n1Department of Atmospheric Sciences, School of Environmental Studies, China University \n\n[TRUNCATED]",

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nAirborne mineral dust affects solar and infrared radiation1,2,\nnucleates ice in clouds3, darkens snow and ice surfaces when\ndeposited there4 and is a health hazard5. Dust deposited to the\noceans and remote land can provide vital nutrients to the\nbiosphere6,7. Predicting dust on climate time scales is immensely\nchallenging; an analysis of 23 global climate models used in the\nFifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on\nClimate Change has shown that they fail to capture basic features\nof Earth’s dust cycle and past inter-annual variability8. Such failures\nof dust models are due to a combination of the difficulty in\nrepresenting the land surface9,10, wet and dry deposition11, the\ndust size distribution and radiative properties11 and the rare high-\nwind events that dominate dust uplift12,13.\nFor the Sahara and Sahel, dust uplift is dominated by the\ndaytime breakdown of the nocturnal low-level jet (LLJ) as well as,\nin the summer, haboobs generated from convective storms. In the\nsummer, when atmospheric dust loads reach their peak and\nconvective activity is at its highest14, haboobs account for 50% of\ndust-generating winds in the southern Sahara15. Despite their\nimportance as a dust uplift mechanisms, haboobs are almost\nentirely absent in models with parameterised convection16, which\nhas been linked to systematic failures in dust forecasts17 and the\ninability of analyses to capture the summertime peak in dust-\ngenerating winds18–20. The lack of haboobs in global climate\nmodels therefore fundamentally limits their ability to represent\ndust uplift and casts serious doubts on their ability to predict how\ndust emissions may change in the future.\nConvection-permitting models, which are run at high enough\nresolution that the parameterisation of convection can be turned\noff, are able to resolve large storms and mesoscale convective\nsystems with much more realistic organisation, as well as allowing\nthe explicit development of downdraughts and cold pools21–23. In\naddition to producing haboobs, the improved representation of\nconvection in convection-permitting simulations has also been\nshown to generate a weaker Sahel–Sahara pressure gradient that\nis more consistent with observations16,22,24. This weakens LLJ\nuplift and demonstrates the potential impact of improved\nrepresentation of convective storms beyond their direct impact\nvia haboobs.

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nThe Earth’s climate is closely linked to the flow of energy in and\nout of the Earth-atmosphere system. At equilibrium, the outgoing\nlongwave radiation (OLR) and the reflected shortwave radiation\n(RSW) (W ⋅m−2) at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) compensate\nthe Incoming Solar Radiation (ISR) on average. Any perturbation of\nthis balance due to a variation of the climate drivers (e.g.\ngreenhouse gases), known as a radiative forcing, leads to a climate\nfeedback which attempts to bring the radiation budget back to\nequilibrium1. A good understanding of the Earth-atmosphere\nsystem and of its long-term changes therefore requires an\naccurate evaluation of the radiative effects of the climate drivers\nand feedbacks on the OLR. Considerable improvements have been\nachieved in the last four decades through the exploitation of\nspectrally integrated OLR from dedicated broadband instruments\n(e.g. refs. 1–6). Different methods, such as the radiative kernel\ntechnique7,8 and the partial radiative perturbation9, have been\ndeveloped to evaluate the contribution of individual variables to\nthe changes in the OLR from broadband measurements. While\nthese techniques are very powerful, they rely on an accurate\nknowledge of the different parameters of interest. For instance, to\nstudy the impact of O3 on the OLR, these techniques exploit\ninfrared satellite retrievals or model outputs, which can both be\nsubject to strong regional biases and inaccuracies.\nIndependent constraints can, in principle, be obtained from\nspectrally resolved OLR (i.e. the integrand of broadband OLR, in\nunits of W ⋅m−2 ⋅(cm−1)−1) derived from infrared hyperspectral\nsounders, which give access to the spectral signature of individual\nclimate processes and feedbacks. While the potential for using\nspectrally resolved OLR (hereafter abbreviated as SOLR) for the\nstudy of climate change has been known for some time (e.g.\nrefs. 10,11), the interest for these measurements has only grown\nrelatively\nrecently\nwith\nthe\nadvent\nof\nstable\nmulti-year\nobservations12. Among the latest achievements, important results\nwere obtained by refs. 13,14 and 15,16 from the measurements of\nthe Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS, aboard NASA’s Aqua\nsatellite17). In particular, they identified a series of biases in climate\nmodels that compensated each other partially, and did not show\nup in comparisons with broadband fluxes. More recently, based on\nan analysis of 10 years of AIRS global-mean radiances, Pan et al.18\ncalculated significant cooling trends in the carbon dioxide (CO2) ν2\nband for channels sensitive to the lower and the mid-stratosphere.\nClear differences were highlighted in trends derived from\nsynthetic AIRS radiances computed by considering the output of\na free-running general circulation model (GCM) and the European\nCentre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECWMF) reanalysis\ndata set (ERA-Interim), confirming the challenges in accurately\nmodeling and assimilating the stratospheric climate.\nThe infrared atmospheric sounding interferometer (IASI19,20) on\nboard the Metop satellites is a hyperspectral sounder like AIRS,\nwhich has the advantage of covering the 645–2760 cm−1 thermal\ninfrared region without any gaps, which makes it well suited for\ndetecting changes in the Earth’s SOLR related to trace gases\nvariations. Because of their different overpass time (9.30 versus\n13.30 a.m. and p.m. local time for IASI and AIRS, respectively), the\njoint exploitation of the measurements from the different infrared\ninstruments (also including the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS)\non Suomi NPP which was launched in 201121 but whose\nmeasurements were never used to date to derived SOLR) could\nprovide meaningful information on, for example, the diurnal cycle\nof the SOLR or for the confirmation of the variations observed in\nthe SOLR.

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nThe understanding of climate variability in West Africa is of prime\nimportance for regional socioeconomic sustainability, especially in\nthe context of climate change and population growth. Since the\ndramatic Sahelian droughts of the eighties, much effort has been\ndevoted to a better scientific understanding and modeling of the\nWest African Monsoon (WAM) system and its connection to global\ndynamics and to regional\nfactors,\nincluding anthropogenic\nperturbations1. For example, at the regional scale, the Saharan\nheat low and the South East Atlantic (SEA) cold tongue intensity,\nland-use changes, and soil moisture feedbacks are important for\nthe meridional distribution of diabatic and moisture sources\nimpacting the WAM regional moist static energy gradient,\nconvective activity, and rainfall2. Absorbing aerosol particles,\nwhich are emitted both naturally and as a result of anthropgenic\nactivity in large quantity over Africa, may also impact monsoon\ndynamics through complex interactions with solar and thermal\nradiation, and with clouds through microphysical effects. The\nimpact of mineral dusts present over the Sahara and Sahel during\nthe June to September (JJAS) WAM season has received much\nattention in studies covering a broad range of spatial and\ntemporal\nscales3–6,\nOn\nthe\ncontrary,\npossible\nimpacts\nof\nbiomass-burning aerosol emissions, which are mostly active over\nsouthern hemisphere Africa during the WAM season, have\nreceived less attention.

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nPhosphorus (P) is critical to life on Earth, and its distribution in\nmarine1 and terrestrial ecosystems2 is shaped by many biogeo-\nchemical processes. Inorganic P species (e.g., mono- or diproto-\nnated orthophosphate) comprise the most bioavailable P forms\nand have been studied for many decades. Organic phosphorous-\ncontaining compounds (org-P), such as nucleic acids, phospholi-\npids, inositol phosphates, phosphoamides, phosphonates, phos-\nphoproteins,\nsugar\nphosphates,\nand\nphosphonic\nacids,\nare\nthought to play a critical role in driving cell growth and\nmetabolism,\nas\nwell\nas\nthe\ncommunity\ncomposition\nof\nmicroorganisms3,4.\nThe org-P compounds are ubiquitous in organisms and thus\ncontribute to the P biogeochemical cycle4. Although in the\natmosphere primary biological particles (bioaerosols) are ubiqui-\ntous5, the amount and speciation of org-P are virtually unknown.\nBioaerosols are composed of organic matter comprising cell\nfragments, pollen (diameter exceeding 10 μm), bacteria (diameter\n~1 μm), fungi, algae, moss, fern spores (diameter ~10 μm), viruses\n(diameter less than 0.1 μm), and fragments from animals and\nplants6. Tracer-based emission rates of bioaerosol (as PM10 mass)\nfor Europe is estimated at 24 kg km−2 y−1, with fungal spores and\nplant debris being the most important contributors to these\nemissions7. Dust also contains high concentrations of biological\nmaterial, mainly from microorganisms or plant detritus8. This\nmaterial may be enriched with additional biological loads (fungal\nspores, bacteria, viruses, pollen, etc.) through the adhesion of\nmicrobe-laden fine aquatic sprays to dust particles as the Sahara\nDesert plume moves over terrestrial and aquatic environments9.\nGlobal modeling studies suggest that desert dust is a major\nsource of P that contributes more than 82% to global P emissions\n(1.4 Tg P yr−1)10. The contribution of bioaerosols to P is 12% and\ncould be as high as 45% in soluble P (0.5 Tg P yr−1, globally)11.\nOn\nthe\nother\nhand,\nWang\net\nal.\n(2015)12\nindicated\nthat\ncombustion-related emissions of atmospheric P (1.8 Tg P yr−1)\nrepresent over 50% of global atmospheric sources of P (3.5 Tg\nP yr−1), suggesting that the perturbation of the global P cycle by\nanthropogenic emissions is greater than previously thought;\nhowever, these estimates are much higher than in other studies.\nThese assessments highlight the uncertainties in understanding\nthe role of atmospheric P in global biogeochemistry.\nThe Mediterranean Sea region has been identified as one of the\nmost climate-sensitive marine ecosystems, with increased vulner-\nability owing to the effects of the increasing demographic and\neconomic development occurring throughout its coastal zone.

However, the likelihood of successive megadroughts in India’s past and future climate remain poorly\nunderstood. Using Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) from the Monsoon Asia Drought Atlas (MADA), we show that the major\nfamines that affected millions of people during 1200–2018 were linked with summer monsoon droughts. Four megadroughts\ncovering more than 40% of the country occurred for two consecutive summer monsoon seasons during 1200–2018. The most\nrecent and severe megadrought occurred in 2002–2003. Simulations from the Community Earth System Model (CESM) for the last\nmillennium (850–2005) ensemble (LME) show that the likelihood of two and three-year consecutive megadroughts during the\nsummer monsoon is about 0.7 and 0.3 events per 100 years, respectively. Large ensemble simulations from CESM (CESM-LE) show a\ndecline in the frequency of megadroughts in the future. Summer monsoon megadroughts are strongly associated with the warm\nsea surface temperature (SST) anomalies over the Pacific Ocean in the past and future climate. Substantial warming under the\nprojected future climate can cause megadroughts under near-normal precipitation during the summer monsoon season. Despite\nthe projected decline in the likelihood of the summer monsoon megadroughts under the warming climate, megadroughts in the\nfuture can have considerable implications for India’s food production and water availability.",
    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nIndian summer monsoon (June–September) accounts for more\nthan 80% of the total annual rainfall1. Rainfall during the summer\nmonsoon plays a vital role in the Indian economy2,3. The Indian\nsummer monsoon has a year-to-year variability of about 10% of its\nlong-term mean1,2. A rainfall deficit of more than 10% is\nconsidered a drought, while rainfall of more than 10% of the\nlong-term mean is termed surplus2. A deficit of 19–21% in rainfall\nin 2002 caused a drought that resulted in an estimated loss of\nbillions of dollars, which was about 1% in the Gross Domestic\nProduct (GDP) of India4. From 1901 through 2010, 17% of the total\nyears experienced drought during the summer monsoon season.\nCharacteristics and the occurrence of droughts during the summer\nmonsoon season are well studied1,4–8. About 18 meteorological\ndroughts occurred in India during the 1870–2018 period7. The\nsevere meteorological and hydrological droughts occurred in\n1876, 1899, 1918, 1965, and 20007. While droughts due to summer\nmonsoon failure have implications, consecutive droughts disrupt\nIndia’s socio-economic well-being. For instance, the drought of\n2015–2018 caused groundwater depletion and affected about\none-fourth of the total Indian population7,8. Similarly, the drought\nof 1875–1876 caused the great famine and affected millions of\npeople in India9,10.\nThe year-to-year variability of the Indian summer monsoon is\ninfluenced by El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO11–16). Warm sea\nsurface temperature (SST) anomalies over the Pacific Ocean are\nnegatively related to the Indian summer monsoon rainfall (ISMR).\nThe negative relationship between summer monsoon rainfall and\nSST anomalies is the strongest over the eastern Pacific region15.\nThe physical mechanism of the linkage between ENSO and the\nIndian summer monsoon is associated with atmospheric circula-\ntion and ENSO-induced SST variability17. The coupled atmospheric\nand oceanic variability modify Walker circulation and connect the\nrising motion over the central-eastern Pacific during a warm phase\nof ENSO with reduced rainfall over India17. While ENSO is one of\nthe significant drivers of the year-to-year variability of the Indian\nsummer monsoon, other forcings are related to SST patterns over\nthe Indian Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, and other parts of the Pacific\nOcean affect ISMR. For instance, Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) is a\ndominant mode of coupled ocean-atmospheric variability, influ-\nencing summer monsoon18–22. A positive phase of IOD is linked\nwith the above-normal summer monsoon rainfall23–25. Moreover,\nIOD modulates the teleconnection between ENSO and ISMR25,26.\nAt the decadal time scale, Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO)\ninfluences the summer monsoon through a modification of the\nWalker circulation and adjustment in the Indian ocean Hadley\ncell27,28. Similarly, at a multidecadal time scale, Atlantic multi-\ndecadal oscillation (AMO) influences the summer monsoon29,30\nthrough modifying the tropospheric temperature gradient17.\nIndia has a long history of famines31–33. Famines caused\nsignificant mortality due to lack of food availability, resulting\nfrom crop failures and other factors9. The history of famines in\nIndia reported in the scientific literature goes back to 503–443\nBC31. Famines occurred in a large number in India during the pre-\nBritish era. While the number of local/regional famines that\naffected a small part of the country is considerably higher31, India\nwitnessed twenty major famines from 1200 to 1945. Out of these\nmajor famines, nine famines were widespread and caused the loss\nof millions of lives in India. The summer monsoon failures and\ndroughts9,31,33 caused a majority of the famines. Agricultural\ndrought due to soil moisture deficit and crop failure resulted in\nfood insecurity, which primarily caused most famines in India\nduring the British Era9,10. For instance, out of six major famines\n(1873–1874, 1876, 1877, 1896-1897, 1899, and 1943) during\n1870–2018, soil moisture drought9 was the ma\n\n[TRUNCATED]",

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nThe 2019–2020 wildfire season in Australia was among the most\ncatastrophic in recorded history, causing severe social, environ-\nmental, ecological and economic impacts across the continent. An\narea larger than the size of the United Kingdom was burned\n(estimates range from 24 to 34 million hectares1), including at\nleast 21 percent of Australia’s temperate forests2,3 and over 3000\nhomes1. Thirty-three deaths occurred as a direct result of the\nfires4. Hundreds more deaths, and thousands of hospital and\nemergency-department admissions, have been attributed to the\nextreme levels of air pollution resulting from the wildfire smoke5,6.\nThe estimated death toll for animals is in the billions1, with fears\nthat some species have been driven to extinction7,8. Recent\nestimates of the total economic loss to Australia resulting from the\n2019–2020 wildfires are in the order of AU$100 billion9,10.\nTwo key factors have been linked to the severity of the\n2019–2020 wildfires. First, the exceptionally dry conditions in the\nyears and months leading up to the fire season produced very low\nfuel-moisture content, especially in eastern Australia11–14. The\nwidespread drought conditions have been connected to the\nstates of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean\nDipole (IOD) in the years and months preceding 202015–17.\nSecond, the extremely hot and dry weather conditions experi-\nenced across Australia during the 2019–2020 summer were\nparticularly favorable to fire ignition and spread11,18–21. A number\nof extreme weather records were broken over this period, which\nincluded Australia’s highest national daily-averaged temperature\n(41.9 oC)15 and record-high values of the Forest Fire Danger Index\n(FFDI) in areas of all Australian States and Territories19. The\nSouthern Annular Mode (SAM), which was strongly in its negative\nphase during the spring and summer of 2019, has been implicated\nin the unusually hot and dry conditions across eastern Australia22.\nMany studies have investigated how climate and weather\nconditions favorable to wildfires in Australia have changed\nhistorically and how they will continue to change into the future.\nPaleoclimate records indicate an increase in the last century in the\noccurrence of the fire-promoting phases of both ENSO23 and the\nIOD15,24. These increases may continue in the coming dec-\nades25,26. Observed records since the mid-twentieth century show\na trend towards more dangerous fire-weather conditions for much\nof Australia27–29 and a corresponding reduction in the time\nbetween major wildfires30. Future projections of Australian fire\nweather are strongly region- and model-dependent, but generally\nindicate increased severity in southeast Australia31–34.\nEstimates of the likelihoods of increased susceptibility to fire\nfrom extreme climate and weather are essential for policy makers,\ncontingency planners, and insurers. However, such likelihoods are\ndifficult to quantify from observed records, which are limited to\napproximately the past century and thus provide few samples of\nextremely susceptible conditions in a given region28,35,36. There\nwas, for example, no direct observational precedent for the high\nvalues of FFDI nor the low annual accumulated rainfall total\nexperienced in southeast Australia in 201915. Further, assessment\nof likelihoods is compounded by nonstationarity in the observed\nrecord, resulting, for example, from climate change. Even if past\nlikelihoods could be well determined from the observed record,\nthey may not be representative of current wildfire susceptibility.\nClimate\nmodels\ncan\nprovide\nlarge\nsamples\nof\nplausible\nconditions over short time periods that can be used to reduce\nuncertainties in quantifying risk.

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nAridity, and associated water scarcity, is a long-term hydrologic\nand climatic condition, exerting pervasive influences on dynamics\nin human society and terrestrial ecosystems (e.g., more frequent\nhydrologic and ecosystem droughts, increased economic losses,\ndecreased land carbon sink)1–3. Recent studies indicate that\naridity, defined in terms of atmospheric supply (precipitation) and\ndemand\nof\nwater\n(potential\nevapotranspiration,\nPET),\nhas\nincreased globally during recent decades and is projected to\nincrease significantly in the future2,4,5. However, uncertainty\nremains in the natural and anthropogenic mechanisms leading\nto changes in such aridity. Natural variability (e.g., Pacific Decadal\nOscillation and El Niño–Southern Oscillation [ENSO]) has been\nfound to modulate large-scale aridity via atmosphere-ocean\nfeedbacks and atmospheric teleconnections6,7; however, the\nnatural variability alone cannot explain increasing aridification at\nlong\ntimescales8–10.\nOverall,\nanthropogenic\ngreenhouse\ngas\nemissions can enhance global precipitation11 and modify stomatal\nconductance and plant water use12, likely relieving the aridity\nstress; however, the ubiquitous increase in PET associated with\ngreenhouse gas-induced warming may aggravate the aridity13.\nThus, the net greenhouse gas effects on global aridity remain\nuncertain and require further research1,12. Given the much shorter\nresidence time and more complex effects of aerosols than those of\ngreenhouse gas emissions14, aerosols have been identified as the\nsecond-largest anthropogenic driver in the Earth system, partially\noffsetting the greenhouse gas effects on drying15,16. Nevertheless,\nthe identification of aerosol aridity effects is challenging because\nof their heterogeneous spatial distribution and direct and indirect\ninteractions with hydrological cycles17,18.\nDefined as the ratio of annual precipitation to PET, the aridity\nindex (AI) has been widely used to characterize the degree of\nmeteorological drought4,5,13,19. Compared with other meteorolo-\ngical drought indices (e.g., Standardized Precipitation Index and\nPalmer Drought Severity Index), the AI is more climatically suitable\nfor the characterization of aridity/wetness condition and for the\nclassification of climate and vegetation over certain regions.\nMoreover, the AI has been shown to closely correlate with the\nchanges of other drought types (e.g., hydrologic drought,\nagricultural drought, ecosystem drought), although it represents\nbackground climatological aridity more than specific drought\nevents19–21. Previous AI studies typically used a single set of\nobservation5,22 or merely model results23–25, thereby limiting the\nrobustness of their findings. Investigations of AI changes were also\nprimarily focused on the roles played by meteorological variables,\nsuch as precipitation and PET4,23,26, without strict quantification of\nthe contributions from major human and natural forcings.\nMoreover, little effort has been made to constrain future AI\nsimulations using multiple historical observations5,27, which could\ninduce significant uncertainty in the AI projections.\nIn this study, we aim to comprehensively disentangle the\nhuman fingerprints from natural internal variability for the AI\nchanges during the 1965 to 2014 period. To decrease the\nuncertainty of long-term AIs, we developed a collection of\nhistorical\nAI\nproducts\nbased\non\nmultisource\nobservational\nprecipitation and reanalysis PET data sets (see Methods and\nSupplementary Note 1). The PET data were derived from the\nmodified Penman–Monteith algorithm28 that includes the effects\nof temperature, humidity, solar radiation, wind speed, and\natmospheric CO2 concentrations.

In addition, more than 1.6 billion\npeople are recipients of water from mountain regions and 50% of\nEarth’s biodiversity centers are in mountain regions2. However, the\nupper reaches (>5000 masl) of mountain landscapes have\nreceived relatively little scientific attention leaving gaps in\nknowledge concerning the key drivers influencing atmospheric\ncirculation, changes in snow and ice extent over time, and climate\nmodel verification that together will decrease uncertainty in the\nclimate change projections needed to plan a sustainable future3.\nWithin the Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH) lie Earth’s highest\nmountains including the foremost Mt.

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nA variety of ocean-atmospheric processes controls the isotopic\ncomposition of precipitation. Since a significant amount of\natmospheric water vapour is generated from the oceans, the\nphysical conditions of the surface ocean leave their imprint on the\nisotopic\ncomposition\nof\nvapour\nand\nprecipitation.\nPost-\nevaporation processes, such as the atmospheric circulation1,\ncondensation of vapour into raindrops2, and their subsequent\nevaporation3, rain–vapour interaction4,5 also strongly affect the\nprecipitation isotopic fractionation. Convective activity, moisture\nflux convergence, and cloud processes6,7 also modulate the\nprecipitation isotopic composition. Compared to oceanic produc-\ntion, the continental production of moisture is relatively small;\nhowever, it may be significant in specific areas depending on the\nbio-geographical condition.\nThe oxygen isotopic (δ18O) profiles of precipitation on an intra-\nseasonal timescale often show a declining trend in some parts of\nIndia, such as Ahmedabad4, New Delhi, and Mumbai8, Port Blair9 in\nthe Bay of Bengal (BoB) during the monsoon season (June to\nSeptember). Such kind of declining effect is most dramatic in the\nnortheast region of India (henceforth represented as NEI; Fig. 1a).\nFor example, Breitenbach et al.10 observed a decrease in δ18O\nvalues ca. 15‰ at Cherrapunjee, Assam. Sinha et al.11 reported\nδ18O variations of Tezpur in NEI and observed a declining trend\nover 10‰. The cause of such depletion in δ18O is believed to be\nthe modulation by ocean-atmospheric processes. A shift in\nmoisture source from the north BoB to the equatorial Indian\nOcean10 and large-scale planetary circulation was speculated12 to\nexplain the reducing trend in δ18O. Recently, Cai and Tian13\ninvoked the concept of westerly and easterly circulations that\nproduced higher and lower precipitation isotopic values, respec-\ntively, in the head Bay region. Their hypothesis, however, cannot\nexplain the mechanism of generating the premonsoon high\nprecipitation isotopic values. The reported Local Meteoric Water\nLine (LMWL) from NEI typically shows a slope like the Global\nMeteoric Water Line (GMWL; ~8) but intercept higher than\n10‰10,12. This shows that a significant amount of recycled water\nvapour contributes to the local precipitation14. Earlier investigators\nmostly ignored the origin and role of this recycled water vapour.\nHere we analysed several rainwater isotopes profiles from NEI,\nincluding a few other sites outside this region, to examine their\nintra-seasonal behaviour and find a more appropriate alternative\nexplanation of this depletion. We propose that the land-surface\nprocesses mediated by plant transpiration play an essential role in\ncontrolling\nthe\nprecipitation\nisotopic\nbehaviour\nduring\nthe\npreceding phase of monsoon in NEI. This produces a strong\nintra-seasonal precipitation isotopic gradient, denoted as LEMPIG\n(Late monsoon Early Monsoon Precipitation Isotope Gradient). The\nobjectives of our study are: What processes control the isotopic\nvariability of precipitation in NEI on an intra-seasonal timescale?\nDoes plant physiology play any role in determining the precipita-\ntion isotopic composition? Whether the internal processes or the\nexternal factors\nplay\na significant\nrole\nin modulating\nthe\nprecipitation isotope values in this region? We follow a multi-\ndisciplinary approach to address these questions. First, we\nexamine a comprehensive data set of precipitation isotopes from\nacross this region and analyse the regional meteorological\nparameters. Second, we analyse the latent heat flux (LE) and net\necosystem exchange (NEE) measured by an eddy-covariance (EC)\nsystem, along with the reanalysis and observed rainfall data. Third,\nwe estimate the recycled ratio (RR: ratio of recycled to the total\nrainfall) of rain on a seasonal scale to constrain the isotopic\nobservations.

We find that the decreased SOA in such mixed-VOC\nconditions can be largely attributed to OH scavenging effect, resulting in reduced consumption of parent aromatics. However,\nvarious changes in SOA oxidation state (i.e., O/C) and oxidation pathways (i.e., more carbonyls formation) are observed following\naddition of isoprene, and the SOA chemical composition may not be similar to any single parent hydrocarbon, which implies the\nexistence of complex interactions between the degradation chemistry for alkenes and aromatics. Under the conditions of this work,\nthe OH scavenging effect is largely determined by gas-phase chemistry, which is expected to be widespread in binary or more\ncomplex systems in ambient air.

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nThe atmospheric (photo-) oxidation of volatile organic compounds\n(VOCs) emitted from natural and man-made sources leads to the\nformation of secondary species, notably pollutants like ozone and\nsecondary organic aerosol (SOA)1–3. It has been recognised that\nSOA contributes a significant fraction of ambient tropospheric\naerosol4,5, which can cause serious air pollution6, damage human\nhealth7, and affect Earth’s climate8,9. The global SOA budget is\nhighly uncertain, and bottom-up estimates of biogenic and\nanthropogenic SOA fluxes are 12−70 and 2−12 Tg year−1,\nrespectively10, suggesting that global SOA is dominated by\nbiogenic sources.\nUnder ambient conditions, a variety of hydrocarbons from\ndifferent sources are SOA precursors and it is expected that\nphotochemical interactions would occur among them during the\nSOA formation process10,11. However, in current chemical trans-\nport models, the parameterisations that describe SOA formation\nare based on SOA yields from single VOC laboratory experiments,\nand it is assumed that the yields are additive across VOC\nmixtures12–16. Compared to single-hydrocarbon laboratory experi-\nments, there have been limited studies to understand how the\npresence of multiple hydrocarbons from anthropogenic and\nbiogenic sources—each of which is being oxidised to form SOA\n—alters SOA formation pathways and composition10,16–18. There-\nfore, laboratory studies under mixed-VOC conditions are needed\nto better understand the sources and formation of ambient SOA,\nwhich could help assess the impact of anthropogenic emissions\non the environment and climate changes more accurately.\nPrevious studies19–22 have shown that biogenic SOA and new\nparticle formation could be suppressed by the presence of\nisoprene, which may be explained by the competition for OH\nradicals between isoprene and other compounds. Recently,\nMcFiggans et al.23 found that the suppression of monoterpene\nSOA yield in the presence of isoprene was caused by the\nscavenging of both OH and low-volatility products by isoprene\nand its oxidation products. This finding could be extended more\nbroadly to the real atmosphere that contains a complex mixture of\ncompounds, implying that the global SOA budget from biogenic\nemissions could be lower than previous estimates24,25. Apart from\nthe interaction between biogenic VOCs, biogenic SOA formation\ncan also be affected by the presence of inorganic anthropogenic\nspecies like SO2 and NOx10,11,16,26–28. A recent field study in south-\neastern USA showed that isoprene-derived SOA production is\ndirectly mediated by the abundance of sulphate, while NOx can\nenhance night-time monoterpene SOA via NO3 oxidation29. All the\nabove studies indicate considerable advances achieved in recent\nyears on understanding of how isoprene and other inorganic\nanthropogenic pollutants (e.g., SO2, NOx) affect biogenic SOA\nformation, through laboratory experiments, field measurements\nand model simulations.\nOn the other hand, the effect of VOC mixtures on SOA\nformation is not conclusive and may enhance or suppress SOA in\ndifferent studies23,30–33.

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nThe East Asian monsoon (EAM) is a subtropical monsoon system\nnorth of 20˚N featuring a seasonal reversal of winds and a contrast\nbetween rainy and dry seasons1,2. On a large scale, it is\nfundamentally\ndriven\nby\nseasonally-varying\nsolar\nradiations,\nshaped by the land-sea thermal contrast and upper-level westerly\njets due to Tibetan Plateau forcing1,3–6. In recent decades, growing\nconcerns over future changes of the EAM in a warming climate are\nwarranted given its profound influence on the livelihoods of more\nthan 1.5 billion people, plus the large uncertainties presented by\nclimate model projections of monsoon precipitation, circulations,\nand seasonality7–11.\nResponse of the EAM’s seasonality to future radiative forcing\nhas been analyzed commonly using precipitation-based monsoon\nindices10–13. Multiple lines of evidence suggested that the future\nwet season in East Asia seemed stretched with a remarkably\ndelayed retreat10–14 and at the expense of the dry duration15.\nWhile\nmost\nstudies\nfocused\non\nseasonal\nchanges\nin\nthe\nfuture10–14, there remains a dearth of research on the future\nevolution of intraseasonal monsoon circulations and rainband\nfeatured by the EAM system1,16, which are more relevant to\nclimate- and weather-related activities. For this reason, we follow a\nrecently developed circulation-based clustering approach to\nderive the EAM annual cycle17. The monsoon cycle consists of\neight intraseasonal monsoon stages, among which the Early-, Mid-\n, and Late-winter stages manifest in anticyclonic circulations and\nwidespread dry-and-cold air masses in East Asia, which are most\ndominant in the Mid-winter. Following the Late-winter, low-level\nsouthwesterlies become prominent in the south during the Spring\nand a quasi-stationary rain belt is then formed in South China\nduring the Pre-Meiyu. The summertime southwesterlies peak in\nthe ensuing Meiyu season, alongside the strongest monsoon rain\nbelts lingering over the Yangtze basin and South Japan. The Mid-\nsummer sees a continent-wide weakening of summer monsoons\nfollowed by the rise of anticyclonic circulations in the Fall, which\ncompletes the annual monsoon cycle. A multi-model weighting\nscheme is proposed to integrate the climate model outputs based\non their competence in reproducing the observed EAM annual\ncycle (see ‘Methods’). Using such a framework, projected changes\nin the monsoon onset, retreat, and precipitation will facilitate\nmore specific and comprehensive policies in optimizing irrigation\nschemes, sowing and harvesting, reservoir management, and\nclimate adaptations in each intraseasonal stage18.\nAnother moot point lies in the causes of the climate sensitivity\nof monsoon precipitation to greenhouse warming9,19–24. While\nwater vapors in the atmosphere largely follow the Clausius-\nClapeyron (C-C) rate (i.e., ~7% K−1)12,19,21,25–27, future precipitation\nchange is likely to scale at a much slower rate than that,\nsuggesting additional processes at work to offset the moistening\nof the atmosphere. Scientists certified that the thermodynamic\neffect\ncould\nbe\ncounteracted\nby\nan\noverall\nslowdown\nof\natmospheric\ncirculations9,19,20,24,28,29,\nplausibly\ndue\nto\nan\nincreased atmospheric static stability in both lower and upper\ntroposphere14,30,31. Paradoxical as it may seem, some studies\nindicated that East Asia might expect both enhanced precipitation\nand strengthened monsoon circulation manifested by an increase\nin lower-level and upper-level winds32 as well as ascending\nmotions21. Apparently, further investigation on the attributions to\nthe future precipitation change in East Asia is much needed.\nSeeing that the monsoon climate in East Asia features pronounced\nvariabilities within seasons, we show that the governing physical\nprocesses could be markedly different in well-defined intraseaso-\nnal stages, offering additional insights into the causes of\nprecipitation changes under anthropogenic warming, and bene-\nfiting climate model evaluation and projection.\nHere we propose a\n\n[TRUNCATED]",

A classical bifurcation theory, a basis of the tipping dynamics of AMOC implicitly assumes that the tipping\npoint is fixed.

It causes a large tipping lag of up to 1300 years, and strongly relaxes the abruptness of tipping as well.\nWe further demonstrate that the tipping modulation can actively occur in past, present, and future climates by quantifying the\neffect during Dansgaard-Oeschger events, meltwater pulse 1A (MWP-1A), and current Greenland ice sheet melting.

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nThe Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) has a\nsignificant impact on the Earth’s climate by conveying a large\namount of heat northward1–4. Its change has a broad climatic\nimpact on the globe, such as on surface temperature, rainfall\npatterns, and sea ice5–8. Paleo-proxy records indicate that melt-\nwater pulses released from ice melt induce variations in the AMOC\nand resulted in abrupt climate change in the past2,9–11. Moreover,\nthe weakened AMOC shown in future climate simulations can\nsignificantly modulate the surface warming pattern (e.g., North\nAtlantic warming hole) response to global warming6–8.\nOne of the profound features of AMOC is that it has a certain\nthreshold for abrupt change to occur12–14. The prototype model\nfor the AMOC, Stommel’s box model12, offers a classic example. It\npredicts an abrupt change in the AMOC at a certain level of\nfreshwater forcing by transitioning from a stable state to another,\nand the threshold is mathematically identified as a bifurcation\npoint. Such thresholds of a system where small perturbation can\ninduce an abrupt and significant change are more generally\nreferred to as a “tipping point”. For the AMOC, these are found in a\nhierarchy of models, including conceptual models12,15, Earth\nsystem models of intermediate complexity15–17, and even some\nfully coupled global climate models18,19. Especially, the bias-\ncorrected National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)\nCommunity Climate System Model (CCSM) showed the rapid\ncollapse of AMOC under doubled atmospheric CO2 concentration\nlevel19.\nThe AMOC is exposed to a changing environment (e.g.,\nmeltwater pulses from ice), thus, its tipping point should be\nconsidered in the context of the response to time-varying external\nforcing (e.g., freshwater forcing). However, many previous studies\nrely on the assumption that the AMOC is in a quasi-equilibrium\nstate under transient forcing (i.e., fast adjustment compared to\nforcing time scale) and do not carefully consider the role of the\nrate of external forcing16,20. Such an approximation may not\nproperly represent the response of the AMOC in a changing\nclimate. From the dynamical system point of view, once the\nforcing becomes time-dependent, the dynamical system becomes\nnon-autonomous, and new dynamical phenomena appear. When\ntime-varying parameters (e.g., in the forcing) occur, the bifurcation\npoint of the dynamical system can be delayed compared to its\nbifurcation point under constant parameters, as the state of the\nsystem fails to instantaneously adjust to a time-varying parameter.\nSuch an effect is often referred to as bifurcation delay or slow\npassage effect21,22 and is ubiquitous in natural phenomena23–26.\nIn this study, we investigated AMOC tipping under transient\nfreshwater forcing over a broad range of forcing time scales from\ndecadal to multi-millennial. A series of transient freshwater forcing\nexperiments were performed using Stommel’s model and an Earth\nsystem model of intermediate complexity, and the impact of the\nfreshwater forcing rate on AMOC tipping was analyzed. We found\nthat the tipping point (i.e., freshwater threshold for an abrupt\nchange), timing, and its abruptness are significantly modulated by\ntransient freshwater flux forcing (FWF), and this variation is\ndenoted as dynamic tipping modulation of the AMOC. Further-\nmore, we provide examples of the freshwater forcing rates of past,\npresent, and future climate, and demonstrate how tipping\nmodulation operates in a changing climate.\nRESULTS\nFundamentals of tipping under stationary freshwater forcing\nTo obtain basic insights into the tipping process of the AMOC, first,\nwe discuss tipping under stationary freshwater forcing using\nStommel’s model12,27, a conceptual AMOC model.

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nUnderstanding how the future hydrological cycle will change at\nregional scales is crucial for impact assessment and adaptation\nplanning1. Previous research has produced apparently conflicting\ninsights on how land hydrological conditions have changed2–5,\nranging from increasing aridity over land6 and further drying in the\nworld’s driest regions7–9, to the acceleration of the hydrological\ncycle10 and increased vegetation “greening” (implying relaxation in\nwater-limitations)11–15. Some studies have suggested that hydro-\nlogical cycle trends are consistent with ‘wet gets wetter and dry\ngets drier’9,16, while others have found that both this and the\nopposite pattern ‘dry gets wetter and wet gets drier’ is detectable\non land3,17. These conflicting findings may stem from different\ninterpretations of ‘drying’, ‘aridity’ and ‘intensification’, depending\non the metrics and spatial-scale aggregation methods used4,18.\nChanges in the terrestrial hydrological cycle have typically been\nexplored by examining trends in just one3,5,9,10,19–21, or a\nsubset16,22–32 of its components, or in aridity metrics that do not\ncapture the full complexity of changes4. Furthermore, many studies\nuse a single-source dataset, so that results are very sensitive to\ndataset choice2,4,24,33 and its inherent uncertainties4,21. Here, we\nundertake a simultaneous analysis of trends in all components of\nthe hydrological cycle and vegetation greenness (based on\nNormalised Difference Vegetation Index; NDVI), using global\nobservationally-derived gridded datasets of P, ET, Q and change\nin total water storage (ΔTWS) that are constrained with in situ\nmeasurements\n(Supplementary\nTable\n1),\nover\nthe\nperiod\n1980–2012. Crucially, our approach imposes physical conservation\nconstraints in calculating trends. The analysis of trends utilises\nmultiple products and observational sources in the derivation of\neach budget component, as well as uncertainty bounds informed\nby observational constraints. Sampling within these uncertainty\nestimates was used to determine the robustness of the trend (see\nMethods). Changes in the hydrological cycle are described at the\ngrid scale (0.25°) and over precipitation regimes derived by\nclustering the land based on precipitation mean and variability\n(Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 2).\nRESULTS\nGlobal patterns of change in the hydrological cycle\nWe first examine the spatial distribution of robust trends in P, Q,\nET, and NDVI over 1980–2012 (Fig. 1 – dark blue and red). We find\nthat 51% of the land surface has experienced robust changes in at\nleast one component of the hydrological cycle. P has changed\nrobustly across ~13% of the land compared to ~34% and 20% for\nET and Q, respectively. Regionally, P and Q show a broad tendency\nfor increases in parts of the Sahel, southern Africa, Eurasia, the\nAmazon, southeast Asia and northern Australia. Declines in both P\nand Q are detected in southwestern North America, southern\nSouth America and parts of Asia. However, robust trends in P (dark\ncolours in Fig. 1) are more limited in spatial extent and less\nspatially coherent than in Q. ET shows robust increases in most of\nEurasia, southern Asia, and western North America.

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nPredicting changes in the pattern of atmospheric circulation and\nassociated atmospheric teleconnections over the tropics is critical\nfor agriculture, water resources, and ecosystem management. The\nWalker circulation consists of the zonal atmospheric overturning\ncells over the tropics with surface westerlies (easterlies) over the\nequatorial Indian (Pacific) Ocean1. Variations in the structure of the\nWalker circulations are closely tied not only to precipitation and\nocean temperature patterns2–5 but also to fishery stocks through\nvariations in nutrient supply caused by the upwelling of cold\nwater6. Recent studies of the Walker circulation over the Indo-\nPacific region have conflictingly suggested either a weakening6–16\nor strengthening1,3,4,17–24 pattern in response to global warming.\nRecent findings have also indicated changes in the Walker\ncirculation using various paleo-proxy datasets and model simula-\ntions of the past climate25–28.\nModel-simulated\nweakening\nof\nthe\nWalker\ncirculation\nin\nresponse to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations has been\nattributed to a differential increasing rate between precipitation\n(~3%/K) and atmospheric water vapor (~7%/K)9,10. However, the\nchanges in the zonal overturning circulation in the tropics can also\nbe explained by enhanced dry static stability over non-convective\nregions29, an influence of solar cycle maxima30, mean vertical\nadvection of stratospheric change31, and trans-basin sea surface\ntemperature (SST) differences12,21,32. In addition, several other\nfactors also contribute to zonal circulation changes. For example,\nthe meridional atmospheric circulation in the Pacific Ocean, which\nis controlled by the anomalously high-pressure centered at mid-\nlatitude, acts to strengthen the ascending branch over the\nwestern Pacific Ocean and contributes to the strengthening of\nthe Walker circulation20. However, no existing study addresses the\ncontribution of meridional circulation to zonal circulation changes\nover the Indian Ocean (IO). Thus, it is essential to understand the\nunderlying physical mechanism of how the local meridional\ncirculation contributes to the zonal circulation changes over the IO\nin a warming world. Furthermore, it is important to find out if the\nSST warming pattern plays role in the weakening of zonal\ncirculation or whether the weakening of zonal circulation causes\nthe SST warming pattern.\nThe IO Walker circulation (IWC) is characterized by a rising\nmotion over the eastern IO (EIO) and a sinking motion over the\nwestern IO (WIO)33. Presently, inter-annual variability of IWC is\nclosely linked to IO Dipole (IOD) events6,33–36. A positive (negative)\nIOD, characterized by lower (higher) than normal SSTs in the\ntropical EIO and higher (lower) than normal SSTs in the WIO37,38, is\noften associated with a weakened33,39,40 (strengthened41) IWC,\nsimilar to how El-Niño (La-Niña) events weaken (strengthen) the\nzonal\ncirculation\nin\nthe\nPacific\nOcean42,43.\nClimate\nmodel\nsimulations forced by a high greenhouse gas emission scenario\n(Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5)) indicate\nincreased occurrences of extreme positive IOD (pIOD) events by\nalmost a factor of three44,45, which is thought to imply a\nweakening of the IWC in a warmer world33,46.\nHowever,\nthe\nreliability\nof\nsuch\na\nprojection\nhas\nbeen\nquestioned due to common model biases in the IO47–50.

At the sea ice maximum in September, the sea ice extent\n(SIE) in the Weddell Sea represents ~36.7% of the total Antarctica\nsea ice cover, and the area contains the largest percentage of\nAntarctic multiyear sea ice of any sector of the Southern Ocean13\n(Supplementary Fig. 1). Nearly four decades (1979–2020) of sea ice\nobservations from passive microwave satellite instruments indi-\ncate a moderate increase of 0.43 ± 0.4% per decade in the\nAntarctic SIE with spatially variable patterns of increasing and\ndecreasing trends in different sectors. The observed variability has\nbeen attributed to a number of complex physical processes that\ninclude atmospheric circulation associated with zonal wave\nnumber three (ZW3)14–19, upper ocean temperature and salinity\nfeedback20,21, regional wind driven sea ice drift22, ozone deple-\ntion, stratospheric cooling23–26 and large-scale surface climate\noscillators such as the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and El Niño\nSouthern Oscillation (ENSO)27–33. In the recent decades, the SAM is\nmodulated by stratospheric ozone depletion resulting surface\nclimate change in the Antarctic and Southern Ocean25. This\nclimate change driven trend has led to intensification and\npoleward movement of westerly winds, upper ocean freshening\nand\ncooling\nof\nthe\nSouthern\nOcean,\nresulting\nsea\nice\ngrowth20,21,28. Several studies using coupled climate models\nshowed the Antarctic sea ice decline in response to increase in\nthe SAM34,35. From the research to date, it is difficult to draw\ndefinite conclusions regarding the causative physical mechanisms\nbehind the observed sea ice changes. Therefore, the physical\nprocesses driving the sea ice changes may not be represented\ncorrectly in climate models due to complex ocean-ice-atmosphere\ninteractions, limiting our confidence in the projections of sea ice\nchanges over the coming decades.\nFollowing the moderate increase in SIE from 1979 to 2015, a\nsudden decrease occurred in spring 2016 with the largest ice loss\nbeing in the Weddell Sea36–39. It is essential to understand the\nocean-atmospheric processes that trigger such rapid declines in\norder to ensure their simulation in models. The Weddell Sea\nsummer SIE and sea ice concentration (SIC) reached their\nminimum in 2016‒2017, which was attributed to polar cyclones\nwith\nrecord\nlow\ncentral\nmean\nsea\nlevel\npressure\n(MSLP),\nreappearance of a polynya, upper ocean warming, and westerly\nwind strengthening that advected multi-year ice out of the\nnorthern Weddell Sea36. Several deep cyclones and ocean eddies\nled to divergence in the sea ice cover and to anomalously record\nlow sea ice conditions over the Weddell Sea and Lazarev Sea.\nThere was also the reoccurrence of a polynya in 2016 and\n201718,40,41.

However, global oscillations such as the El-Nino\nSouthern Oscillation (ENSO) modulate both the rainfall over India and aerosol loading over the AS. This study uses long-term\nsatellite-based aerosol and gridded rainfall datasets to explore the correlation between AS aerosol and CI rainfall and their\nrelationship to ENSO. It is found that the highest correlation is during El-Nino (0.53), followed by Normal (0.44) and La-Nina (0.34)\nyears, closely following the overall dust aerosol loading over the AS. Spatially, irrespective of the phase of ENSO, the high aerosol\nloading conditions are associated with increased winds over the AS, shifting eastward towards the Indian mainland and enhancing\nrainfall over CI and elsewhere across the Indian landmass. In contrast, the low aerosol loading conditions over the AS are associated\nwith reduced winds, shifting westward away from the Indian mainland, suppressing rainfall over CI. In response to anthropogenic\nclimate change, the El-Nino-like conditions are likely to increase in the future, making the dust aerosol-induced monsoon rainfall\nenhancement/modulation significant.",
    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nThe atmospheric aerosols can modulate Earth’s climate directly by\nscattering and absorbing the incoming solar and outgoing\nterrestrial longwave radiation1–3 and indirectly by acting as cloud\ncondensation nuclei and ice nuclei, thereby modifying the overall\ncloud properties4–6. Aerosols impact the local, regional and global\nclimate at different temporal and spatial scales through these\neffects. They also modulate the Indian summer monsoon rainfall\n(ISMR) through multiple pathways7–13. For example, solar dimming\ninduced by anthropogenic aerosols over the northern hemisphere\nslows down monsoon circulation by altering the north-south\nsurface temperature gradient, reducing rainfall over the Indian\nregion14. This mechanism has been responsible for changes in\nmonsoon rainfall since the second half of the 20th century. On the\nother hand, the atmospheric absorption by aerosols such as dust\nand black carbon during the pre-monsoon season enhances early\nmonsoon rainfall by the elevated heat pump hypothesis (EHP)15,16.\nThe physical mechanism underlying the delayed response in\nmonsoon rainfall to pre-monsoon aerosol loading through EHP\nstill eludes the scientific community17–20. Against this backdrop, a\nstudy showed that remote aerosols over West Asia/North Africa\nand the Arabian Sea(AS) modulate monsoon rainfall on short time\nscales of about a week21. The hypothesis states that the dust\naerosols accumulated over the AS cause atmospheric warming to\nstrengthen\nthe\nmonsoon\ncirculation,\nleading\nto\nincreased\nmonsoon rainfall over Central India (CI) in about a week. Following\nthis, few other studies using extensive satellite-based measure-\nments and simulations conducted by global and regional climate\nmodels supported these findings and suggested similar hypoth-\neses and a few different variants22–24. In addition, in the future\nwarming scenarios, studies have indicated that the positive\ncorrelation between dust loading over the AS and rainfall over\nIndia may likely strengthen due to the increased wind speed over\nthe\ndust-source\nregions\nleading\nto\nincreased\ntransport\nof\naerosols25. Thus, the Indian monsoon rainfall is modulated by\nremote dust feedback to a certain extent.\nThe ENSO significantly impacts both the ISMR and dust loading\nover the AS. The El-Nino years are associated with deficit rainfall,\nand most of the La-Nina years are associated with surplus rainfall\nover India during the monsoon period26,27. Studies have also\nshown that the changes in the circulation patterns and rain\nassociated with ENSO affect the emission and transport of dust\naerosols from nearby dust-source regions to AS28,29. Therefore,\nchanges in ENSO phases may alter the strength of the AS dust-\nmonsoon relationship with implications to monsoon rainfall.\nSome studies have explored the effect of ENSO in modulating\nthe EHP mechanism over the Tibetan Plateau30,31. However, no\nobservational studies have examined the relationship between\nArabian Sea aerosols and Indian monsoon rainfall and its\nsensitivity to ENSO. Also, recent studies have indicated that El-\nNino-like conditions will increase in the future due to anthro-\npogenic climate change32,33. Therefore, it is essential to under-\nstand how ENSO may modulate the relationship between AS dust\naerosol and monsoon rainfall.

The reduced BKS sea ice and resultant upward turbulent heat fluxes can intensify a Rossby\nwave train propagating equatorward to the TP. As a result, the enhanced southwesterlies towards the TP strengthen the warm\nadvection over most parts of the TP and lead to TP warming.

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nThe Tibetan Plateau (TP, often called the third pole) covers an area\nof about 2.5 million square kilometers with an average altitude of\nover 4000 m1. It holds thousands of glaciers and is the source of\nmany Asian rivers such as the Yellow River and Yangtze River2,3.\nServing as the water tower of Asia4,5, the rivers originating from\nthe TP provide water for about 40% of the world’s population. The\nunique topography of the TP exerts a significant influence on the\nAsian monsoon and even the global climate through the dynamic\nand thermal effects6–9. In the context of global warming, the\nannual warming rate in the TP is 0.34 °C/decade during 1979–2020\nbased on the ERA5 reanalysis10, which is faster than the global\naverage and second only to the Arctic among all regions in the\nworld10–12. The observed warming trend exists in all seasons but\nthe strongest warming occurs in winter, followed by autumn10–12.\nAs a result, the frequency and intensity of extreme weather and\nclimate events in the TP have increased significantly13, and the\nglaciers have melted intensively3,14. The reasons behind the\nenhanced TP warming are complex, and some mechanisms have\nbeen proposed, including the increase of greenhouse gas\nemissions9,15 and atmospheric water vapor16,17, snow and ice\nalbedo feedback17,18, the weakened winter monsoon19, increased\nlower clouds20,21 and brown clouds22,23, and the land use24,25.\nHowever, it is not yet clear which process is dominant.\nMeanwhile, owing to the unique environmental characteristics\nand rich natural resources, the Arctic has attracted much attention\nfrom scientists and governments worldwide26–28. The climate in\nthe Arctic has undergone unprecedented changes. Particularly,\nthe near-surface temperature of the Arctic has risen at a rate more\nthan twice the global average29 and even more than four times in\nwinter during the recent decades.

The mechanisms responsible for the AA\nhave been widely discussed32–37, and some studies36,37 indicate\nthat the Arctic sea ice loss38,39 plays an important contribution.\nSo far, however, there have been no reports connecting the TP\nwarming with the rapid change in the Arctic sea ice to our\nknowledge. It is suggested that the reduction of the Arctic sea ice\ncan intensify aerosol transport to the TP40, increase the frequency\nof Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall extremes41 and heatwaves in\nsouthwestern China42, and deepen the East Asian Trough in late\nwinter43.

Near-term climate forcers (NTCFs)\nincluding methane, ozone (O3) and aerosols, have much shorter\nlifetimes than CO2, and provide opportunities for short-term\nmitigation. Unlike for CO2, their climate forcing is determined by\nthe rate of emissions2.\nMethane (CH4) is a potent GHG but has a short lifetime\ncompared with CO2 (9.1 ± 0.9 years, total atmospheric lifetime3),\nmainly due to its reaction with the hydroxyl radical (OH). Since\npre-industrial times, anthropogenic methane emissions have\ncaused more than a doubling of the abundance of methane in\nthe atmosphere, with rapid growth in recent years4, and especially\nin 2020 (gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends_ch4/).

Shindell et al.8 explored a\nmethane concentration reduction of 30% compared to the\npresent\nday\n(2015)\nusing\nan\nensemble\nof\nmodels.\nThey\nattributed\na\nglobal\npopulation-weighted\nozone\nexposure\ndecrease of 2–2.5 ppb, and a temperature decrease of 0.18 ±\n0.02 K to the methane change.\nWhilst simpler climate models (e.g. Hayman et al.19) can be used\nto rapidly assess the surface temperature effects of different\nemissions scenarios, their interactive modelling of methane\nprocesses, particularly the effects of methane on tropospheric\noxidising capacity, are limited. On the other hand, general\ncirculation models (GCMs) and Earth system models (ESMs) are\nable to represent the atmospheric processes involving methane\nmore fully. Traditionally, these complex models use a methane\nlower boundary condition (LBC): a global time-varying methane\nsurface concentration pre-calculated from emissions. This leads to\na buffering effect at the surface, which limits the feedback of\natmospheric oxidation on methane levels20.

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nGlobal subtropical precipitation undergoes an observed and\nprojected decline under global warming1,2, with considerable\nregional and temporal variability3,4. The East Asian summer\nmonsoon region is projected to have enhanced precipitation\nand more extreme events in the late 21st century5. Therefore,\nsouthern China, which includes a subtropical coastline in the East\nAsian monsoon region, features large variability of precipitation\nand is vulnerable to global warming. How the precipitation over\nsouthern China varies with climate change is an important\nsocioeconomic issue, because southern China holds about 2/3 of\nthe population of China, and urbanized regions such as the Pearl\nRiver Delta have been expanding in southern China as a fast-\ngrowing economic center and high-tech hub. The infrastructure\ninside this metropolitan area is vulnerable to high-impact weather\nevents such as heavy precipitation and drought6. Policy makers\nand investors should be better prepared for the potential risks due\nto the future precipitation trend under global warming.\nThe rainy season in southern China ranges from April to\nSeptember, the first half of which is called the pre-rainy season,\ni.e., April to June7,8. The diabatic heating produced by such an\nintense rainy season is a major part of the East Asian summer\nmonsoon heating, which affects the structure and strength of the\nsubtropical high over the Pacific and tends to force a stationary\nwave pattern of global influence, for instance on the American-\nAtlantic regions9–13. Around mid-May, the onset of the South\nChina Sea summer monsoon (SCSSM) marks the commencement\nof the monsoonal rainy season14–16. After the SCSSM onset,\nprecipitation over southern China increases more than 40% as\ncompared to that before the monsoon onset16. The precipitation\nof the pre-rainy season is classified into cold frontal precipitation\nand summer monsoonal precipitation with respect to the SCSSM\nonset15,16. The first type of precipitation is linked to cold fronts,\nwhich are closely associated with synoptic disturbances in the\nmid-latitudes17,18. The second type is associated with convective\ninstability and quasi-stationary fronts, which are the slow-moving\nand long-lasting East Asian summer monsoon systems, with large\nspatial coverage over land and ocean15. Variation in the quasi-\nstationary fronts is modulated mainly by the western North Pacific\nsubtropical high, tropical sea surface temperature (SST), westerly\njet streams, and atmospheric eddies from the mid-latitudes17–20.\nBoth tropical and mid-latitude forcings are thus crucial for the pre-\nrainy season precipitation over southern China. In this study, the\npre-rainy season is divided into two periods, the pre-monsoon\nonset (pre-MO) and post-monsoon onset (post-MO), with respect\nto the SCSSM onset due to the different forcings involving\nprecipitation.\nWhile the SCSSM has tended to commence earlier and has\nintensified since the early 1990s, the summer precipitation over\nsouthern China experienced a prominent decadal strengthening\nin the mid-1990s21–25. Besides the summer decadal trend, Zhu\net al.26 found an out-of-phase decadal shift in the spring and\nsummer precipitation over southern China from 1979–1992 to\n1997–2010, with drier springs and wetter summers in the latter\nperiod. They proposed that a springtime La Niña-like decadal SST\nanomaly pattern in the tropical Pacific could trigger more\nconvection over the Maritime Continent and cause anomalous\ndescending motion over southern China, while summertime\ndecadal warming over the Indian Ocean could inhibit convection\nover the Maritime Continent and strengthen the monsoon trough\n1Guy Carpenter Asia-Pacific Climate Impact Center, Center for Ocean Research in Hong Kong and Macau (CORE), School of Energy and Environment, City University of Hong\nKong, Hong Kong SAR, China. 2School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA. 3School of Atmospheric Sciences and Guangdon\n\n[TRUNCATED]",

Under-\nstanding how ARs change in the future is critical for managing\nwater resources in local communities.\nSolar geoengineering, in particular stratospheric aerosol injection\n(SAI), has been debated as a possible intervention method to\nreduce some of the worst effects of global warming. In recent years,\nit has become clear that reaching important climate targets will be\nincreasingly difficult due to the continued use of fossil fuels and\nsubsequent increase in greenhouse gas emissions. Scientific debate\non the wisdom of climate intervention strategies has populated the\nscientific literature for over a decade18–21. SAI has been proposed to\nhave the potential to mitigate the effects of climate change until\ngreenhouse gas\nconcentrations can\nbe sufficiently\nreduced.\nHowever, large uncertainties still exist in our understanding of the\nimpacts of these methods. Do the risks and dangers of engineering\na solution to combat serious climate change impacts outweigh the\nbenefits of such an exercise? To answer this question, first, we must\nfully understand the consequences of different climate intervention\nstrategies. The recent National Academies of Sciences, Engineering\nand Medicine (NASEM) report on solar geoengineering research\nand governance22 concluded that studies done to date do not\nprovide a sufficient basis for supporting informed decisions and\nrecommends research to better characterize and reduce uncertain-\nties concerning benefits and risk of solar geoengineering deploy-\nment. One set of tools at our disposal are Earth System Models\n(ESMs) as evidenced by the GeoMIP (Geoengineering Model\nIntercomparison Project) effort, where different modeling centers\naround the world applied the same climate engineering scenarios\nto their ESMs in order to assess climate projections23. Due to the\nparticipation of varying ESM-complexity, some GeoMIP experiments\nhave been simplified and utilized solar constant reduction or a\nprescribed aerosol distribution24,25. In addition, even the more\ncomplex experiments performed stratospheric injections at the\nequator which have led to overcooling of the tropics and\nundercooling of the poles26.

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nThe tropical western Pacific (TWP), where the world’s largest warm\npool is located, is characterized by the warmest sea waters among\nthe tropical oceans, with the annual sea surface temperature (SST)\nexceeding 28 °C1. The TWP has dramatic impacts on the world’s\nweather and climate2–4. The TWP is an essential source of kinetic\nenergy and water vapor5,6, driving large-scale\natmospheric\ncirculations and affecting precipitations locally and remotely7,8.\nConsidering the large heat content and high SST in the TWP, it can\neasily trigger strong and deep convections. Consequently, it heats\nthe upper-level troposphere9 and transports water masses and\nenergies toward the eastern Pacific and higher latitudes through\nboth the Walker and Hadley circulations5,10. In addition to the\nlocal convective precipitation, the TWP can affect the monsoonal\nrainfall in East Asia via atmospheric teleconnection11,12. It also\nprofoundly influences the numbers, genesis frequency, and tracks\nof tropical cyclones in the western North Pacific13–15. A previous\nstudy suggested that the size and intensity of the warm pool have\nundergone significant increases under the human-caused global\nwarming16. It is almost certain that the impacts of the TWP on the\nglobal climate will increase substantially in the future. Therefore, it\nis of importance to understand the driving mechanisms and\nimprove the prediction skills of the TWP SST variability by\nsearching useful precursors.\nThe TWP is influenced by the convergence of tropical ocean\ncurrents driven by trade winds, local air-sea feedbacks (e.g., cirrus\ncloud; evaporation; convection), and large-scale atmospheric\ncirculations17–19. The TWP warm SST episodes occur with a\npreference for spring and fall7 when the maximum solar\nradiation reaches the tropics20. The seasonal variations of the\nTWP SST also result from the net surface heat fluxes associated\nwith trade and monsoonal winds and horizontal/vertical oceanic\nadvection21. On the interannual time scale, the TWP is an\nessential counterpart of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)\ncycle. The migration of the warm pool (including centroid, east\nedge, and size) associated with surface winds and zonal oceanic\nadvection is in phase with the ENSO variation22,23. In addition,\nheat content in the TWP also influences the intensity of the\nfollowing ENSO24. Previous studies have demonstrated that the\nTWP SST and ENSO are closely correlated when ENSO leads by\n5 months and the coverage of the warm pool expands eastward\nafter\nthe\npreceding\nENSO20.\nMoreover,\nthe\nENSO-induced\nwestward propagation of Rossby waves can influence the TWP\nSST variation and deep convection activities25. As suggested in\nthe previous study, the close relationship between the TWP and\nENSO enriched our understanding\nof\nthe\ntropical\nocean-\natmosphere interactions and using the TWP as a precursor\ngreatly improved the prediction skills of ENSO22. However, as\nmost previous and current studies focus on the eastern Pacific\nSST variability predictions, the model performances in reprodu-\ncing and predicting the TWP SST variability are far from skillful26.\nThere is an urgent need to improve the predictability of the\nwarm pool considering its dramatic impacts on the climate\nsystem, but finding useful precursors still remains an unresolved\nissue in the current literature.\nRecent studies have highlighted a significant leading influence\nof extratropical variability on the tropical climate through air-sea\ninteractions, particularly over the Northeast Pacific27–30. The\npropagations of extratropical SST anomalies to the tropics have\nbeen found in both hemispheres associated with the North/South\nPacific meridional mode (NPMM/SPMM)31,32, which has great\nimplications for extending the predictability of the tropical\neastern/central Pacific SSTs in terms of the time lags during the\nevolution33,34.

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nThe Madden–Julian Oscillation1 (MJO) has recently been exploited\nas a source of skillful subseasonal predictability for United States\n(US) severe convective storms (SCSs; tornadoes, severe hail, and\ndamaging convective wind gusts)2–4. SCSs are a perennial source\nof insured losses totaling $10B annually5 in the US, and their\nextended-range prediction remains an area of significant stake-\nholder interest6. The MJO is characterized as a meso-α cluster of\ndeep convection in the Indian Ocean that migrates eastward into\nthe Indo-Pacific warm pool with a timescale between 30 and\n90 days7,8. Diabatic latent heating associated with extensive MJO\nconvection can generate Rossby waves9–14, as the divergent\ntropopause-level flow advects potential vorticity poleward and\ninteracts with mid-latitude westerly jets15–17. MJO-induced wave\ntrains often propagate poleward and eastward toward North\nAmerica, altering the atmospheric circulation and associated\nprobability and frequency of extreme temperatures and precipita-\ntion18–23, atmospheric rivers24,25, snowstorms26,27, hurricanes28,29,\nand SCSs30–33. In short, increasing our understanding of the MJO’s\ninfluence and variability on extratropical extreme weather is vital\nto enhancing skillful subseasonal forecasts34.\nThe MJO can be objectively characterized using a myriad of\ninstantaneous or time-filtered tropical kinematic and thermody-\nnamic quantities. The Real-time Multivariate MJO35 (RMM) index\nuses meridional averages of outgoing longwave radiation (OLR)—\nalong with 850-hPa and 200-hPa tropical zonal winds—to classify\nthe MJO into one of eight phases and determine relative strength.\nThe OLR-based MJO index36 (OMI) aims to capture deep\nconvection,\nderived\nby\nprojecting\n20–96\nday\nfiltered\nOLR\nanomalies onto the two leading spatial EOF patterns. Previous\nstudies investigated the relationships between these MJO indices\nand US tornado and hail occurrence. For example, April tornado\ndays were more likely during MJO RMM phases 6 and 8, whereas\nMay tornado days were more likely during MJO RMM phases 5 and\n830. Violent tornado outbreaks in the boreal spring were more\nthan twice as likely during MJO RMM phase 231. A comprehensive\nanalysis examining OMI and RMM noted enhanced frequency of\ntornado days during phase 2 of the RMM, whereas OMI produced\nnon-statistically significant results, highlighting the sensitivity of\nmethods37. Strong instantaneous correlations between days with\nanomalous hail frequency and RMM MJO phase have also been\nnoted32.\nIn addition, the MJO has recently been leveraged to highlight\npotential SCS “forecasts of opportunity”2,3. Specifically, a statisti-\ncally significant increase in central Great Plains tornado and hail\nfrequency was evident 3–4 weeks following MJO OMI phase 8 and\nseveral weeks following phases 1 and 22. A research team used\nthe MJO in a pseudo-operational setting during April–May 2019 to\nanticipate an above-average tornado-frequency period 3–4 weeks\nin advance, which verified with tornado counts more than triple\nthe expected 30-year average4. The onset of the significant MJO\nevent was immediately followed by a period of above-average\nEarth-relative atmospheric angular momentum (AAM), subsequent\nbreakdown of a strong zonally oriented north-Pacific jet stream,\nretrogression of the Rossby wave pattern over the conterminous\nUS, and a favorable synoptic-scale atmospheric regime for\nSCSs3,38.\nMany studies examined the concurrent relationship between\nMJO phase and SCS frequency, but have omitted physical\ncharacteristics (e.g., strength, propagation speed) of individual\nMJO events that may have varied time-lagged responses.

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nNitrate (NO\u0001\n3 ) and its precursor NOx (NOx = NO + NO2) play a\ncrucial role in atmospheric chemical processes and the formation\nof PM2.5, fine particles with diameter less than 2.5 μm1,2. Tropo-\nspheric NOx oxidation drives the formation of ozone (O3) and\nrecycle of hydroxyl radicals (OH) that control the atmospheric self-\ncleansing capacity3. Majority of NOx emitted from various sources\nare finally converted into nitric acid (HNO3) and organic nitrate\n(e.g.,\nRONO2)\nthrough\natmospheric\noxidation\nprocesses\nby\noxidants (e.g., O3, OH, HO2, and RO2)4. HNO3 lowers the pH of\nthe precipitation and increases the risk of forming acid rain5.\nFurthermore, HNO3 easily be transformed into nitrate particles\nthrough atmospheric reactions with alkaline ammonia that in turn\ninfluence the chemical composition and the size of existing\nparticles, affecting the formation of clouds and precipitation as\nwell3,6. RONO2 can partition into the particle phase (RONO2(p)) and\nthen is removed from the atmosphere by deposition to the\nsurface or through hydrolysis to form inorganic nitrate and\nalcohols7,8.

NO2 can be hydrolyzed on surfaces to produce\nHNO3(aq)10, which was found to be a weak source of nitrate\nformation on severe haze days in winter in the North China Plain\n(NCP)11,12. In addition, NO2 can also react with O3 to form NO3\nradicals and then NO3 directly reacts with hydrocarbon (HC) and\ndimethylsulfide (DMS) or be hydrolyzed on surfaces to produce\nHNO313–15.

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nWith the country’s food production and economy depending on\nit1,2, the Indian summer monsoon rainfall (ISMR) is the lifeline of\none-fifth of the world’s population living in the region. It is not\nsurprising, therefore, that developing a model for forewarning of\nISMR one season in advance has a history of more than a century\nin India led by the pioneering work of Blanford3. Despite great\nadvances in ocean-atmosphere observation, computing resources,\ndevelopment of improved empirical4,5 and coupled climate\nmodels for ISMR prediction, the prediction of ISMR remains a\ngrand challenge problem in climate science6. Although many\ndifferent predictors have been identified for predicting ISMR since\nthen7, the El Nino and Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has remained\nthe leading predictable driver of ISMR, even though the relation-\nship between ISMR and an ENSO index shows a weakening trend\nin recent decades (Supplementary Fig. 1b8) with a tendency for\nrecovery to higher negative correlations in more recent years.\nWith\nISMR\ndefined\nfrom\nanother\ndataset9,\nhowever,\nthe\nENSO–ISMR correlation continues to decrease in recent years.\nFurther, the maximum negative correlation between ISMR and\nNino3.4 SST takes place 3–4 months after the peak of ISMR\n(Supplementary Fig. 1c), suggesting a potential role of ISMR in\ndriving the ENSO. In fact the lead–lag relationship (Supplementary\nFig. 1c) indicates that the ISMR could feedback and influence the\nENSO10 making the ENSO–ISMR relationship tangled11,12 and\npotentially a bi-directional causality. It is also notable that the\nENSO–ISMR relationship undergoes a multi-decadal variation\n(Supplementary Fig. 1b13) implying that there are periods when\nENSO could explain up to 35% of inter-annual variability of ISMR\nwhile there are periods when it could explain less than 10% of\nISMR variability. Further, it is noted that a nearly equal number of\nfloods and droughts occur without a La Nina or an El Nino\n(Supplementary Fig. 1a), indicating the role of non-ENSO drivers\non observed inter-annual variability of ISMR.\nA recent study14 argues that the traditional “signal-to-noise”\nestimates of “potential skill” or limit of potential predictability are\nunderestimated and a model-based estimate of “potential skill”\nindicates that it could be much higher than previously thought\nexplaining up to 70% of inter-annual variability of ISMR, far\nbeyond that could be explained by association with the ENSO.\nSome additional sources of ISMR predictability come from other\nslowly varying potential drivers like the Eurasian snow cover15–18,\nPacific\nDecadal\nOscillation\n(PDO)19,20,\nIndian\nOcean\nDipole\nMode21–23, the Atlantic Nino24–27 and Atlantic tripole28, have\nbeen explored recently. However, the physical mechanisms\nthrough which they influence the ISMR, the robustness of the\nrelationships, and the fraction of ISMR variability explained by\nthem are still being debated. As a result, the causality and the\ndirection of causality between these potential drivers and ISMR\nare neither well established nor their independence from the\nENSO and the North-Atlantic sea-surface temperature (SST)\nvariability is established.\nIn addition to the ENSO, there is considerable evidence that cold\nNA SSTs are associated with mega-droughts of Indian monsoon in\nthe past29,30. In recent years, the NA SST is also linked with ISMR on\nmulti-decadal time-scales28,31–35.

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nAerosols exert critical influences on the climate system through\ndirect and indirect radiative forcing. Although great progress has\nbeen made during the past decades in understanding the\nimportant effects of aerosols on climate, they are still among\nthe largest uncertainties in understanding and projecting climate\nchanges1–5. It is challenging to accurately quantify the aerosol\nimpacts on the climate system because of insufficient under-\nstanding of the integrated aerosol radiative effects and drastic\nvariations of aerosols in both temporal and spatial scales6–10.\nAerosols interact with the planetary boundary layer (PBL)\nthrough aerosol radiative forcing4,11,12. Aerosol-PBL interactions\n(API) are reported as one of the key mechanisms in the formation\nof severe air pollution5,13,14. In particular, aerosols are known to\ninhibit the development of the PBL by regulating surface sensible\nheat (SH)15–18. A shallow PBL would, in turn, favor the accumula-\ntion of aerosols, leading to the well-recognized positive feedback\nin the API11,13,19,20. However, the PBL entrainment, a process\nrepresenting the turbulent exchange of air masses and heat fluxes\nbetween the PBL and the free atmosphere21,22, has not been well\nunderstood in the context of API. Because turbulent fluxes within\nthe PBL cannot be solved mathematically22, the entrainment\nproblem and the possible feedback with aerosol, as noted in this\nstudy, reflect the fundamental complexity of a multi-scale chaotic\nsystem.\nAs one of the cornerstones in parameterizing the PBL23,24, a\nlinear scheme has been used to characterize the vertical heat\nfluxes and the relationship between surface SH fluxes (FHS) and\nentrainment fluxes (FHzi) in popular models such as the Weather\nResearch and Forecasting25 and the European Centre for Medium-\nRange Weather Forecasts (ECMWF24,26). The following widely used\nparameterization was initially proposed by Ball27, followed by\nBetts28 and Deardorff29:\nAi ¼ \u0002FHzi=FHS;\n(1)\nwhere Ai is called the entrainment parameter. In this way, the\nentrainment fluxes can be derived from the surface fluxes21,25.\nWhile the entrainment parameter is set as an empirical constant in\nthe previously mentioned studies, we argue that Ai can vary\nconsiderably with aerosol properties and vertical distributions.\nAerosols may come into play in two ways. First, aerosol can reduce\nthe surface sensible heat by diminishing sunlight, thus weakening\nentrainment and shallowing the PBL. Second, aerosols can modify\nthe thermodynamic structure in the PBL and cause a deviation\nfrom the linear structure of heat fluxes, modifying the entrain-\nment. The former effect has been widely recognized13,16,20,\nwhereas the latter remains largely uncertain, motivating this study.\nUsing comprehensive field observations made in Beijing, China,\nwe examined the response of the entrainment process to aerosols.\nIn particular, we obtained the entrainment rate from the lidar-\nderived PBL growth. In harmony with variations in aerosol\nradiative forcing, drastic changes in entrainment rates are noted\nfor\ndifferent\naerosol\nloadings.\nBesides\nits\nloading,\naerosol\nabsorptions and vertical distributions can exert strong and\nnonlinear impacts on the vertical distribution of buoyancy,\naffecting the entrainment process. We propose a mechanism of\naerosol-entrainment coupling to demonstrate the notable inter-\nactions between aerosols and the entrainment process in the\nvertical. As a critical part of API, such an aerosol-entrainment\ncoupling leads to a much greater sensitivity of observed\nentrainment rates to aerosols than suggested by traditional\ncalculations.\n1Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences & ESSIC, University of Maryland at College Park, College Park, MD, USA. 2Program in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences,\nPrinceton University, Princeton, NJ, USA. 3State Key Laboratory of Remote Sensing Science, College of Global Change and Earth System Science, Beijing Normal University, Beijing,\nChina.\n4Key\nLaboratory\n\n[TRUNCATED]",

The different influence degrees\nof aerosols are reflected in the changes of various meteorological\nparameters, especially the changes in basic meteorological\nelements, such as temperature and precipitation8–13.\nThe effects of aerosols on precipitation are essential but poorly\nunderstood, and many scholars have carried out a series of\nstudies about that14–17. Aerosols affect precipitation through ARI\nand ACI processes18. Rosenfeld et al.7 found that aerosols can\nboth decrease and increase rainfall as a result of their radiative\nand cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activities.

Using large ensembles of a global coupled climate model, we show that in response to\nincreasing greenhouse gases, the time scale of KE sea surface height (SSH) shifts from interannual scales toward decadal and longer\nscales. We attribute this increased low-frequency KE variability to enhanced mid-latitude oceanic Rossby wave activity induced by\nregional and remote atmospheric forcing, due to a poleward shift of midlatitude surface westerly with climatology and an increase\nin the tropical precipitation activity, which lead to stronger atmospheric teleconnections from El Niño to the midlatitude Pacific and\nthe KE region. Greenhouse warming leads to both a positive (elongated) KE state that restricts ocean perturbations (e.g., eddy\nactivity) and stronger wind-driven KE fluctuations, which enhances the contributions of decadal KE modulations relative to short-\ntime scale intrinsic oceanic KE variations.

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nThe Kuroshio Extension (KE) is an eastward inertial meandering jet\nof the Kuroshio current located east of Japan, exhibiting the\nlargest air-sea fluxes and the strongest mesoscale eddy activity\nacross the North Pacific basin1,2. The KE is a major part of the\nPacific western boundary currents (WBCs) system that transports\nsubstantial heat from the tropics to midlatitudes and subsequently\nreleases most of that heat to the atmosphere via turbulent fluxes\nof latent and sensible heat3. The strongly coupled KE system\ndynamically interacts with the extratropical Pacific storm track as a\nmidlatitude oceanic frontal zone4–7 and, in turn, further impacts\nlarge-scale climate modes over the midlatitude Pacific8–12.\nPacific sea surface height (SSH) variability is most prominent in\nthe KE region [33°–40°N, 140°–165°E] (black box in Fig. 1a) on\nseasonal-to-decadal timescales. Changes in the eddy kinetic\nenergy (EKE) field over the upstream [140°–153°E] KE region (left\nbox in Fig. 1b) largely contribute to the seasonal-to-interannual\ntime scales of KE variability13,14. This short-time scale KE variation\nis strongly linked to oceanic intrinsic nonlinearities, characterized\nby an apparent bimodality3,15–18. The bimodal KE fluctuations\ninclude an elongated state, when the EKE level decreases and the\nKE jet is relatively straight and stable, and a contracted state, in\nwhich the EKE increases with a spatially convoluted KE path and\nlarge meanders19,20. EKE changes are mainly caused by oceanic\ninstability regarding the internal adjustment via the convergence\nof eddy heat flux and also non-linear interactions of the strong\ncurrent and eddies21. In contrast, basin-wide wind changes over\nthe midlatitudes are the primary forcing of the decadal variability\nof KE SSH flucutations2,10,20,22–26. Specifically, atmospheric forcing\nassociated with the North Pacific internal variability, which is also\nlargely associated with El Niño and Southern Oscillation (ENSO)\natmospheric teleconnections and their imprints on the “redness”\nof the spectrum27,28, drives oceanic baroclinic adjustment that\ncarries wind-induced oceanic Rossby waves westwards towards\nthe WBCs, especially the downstream [153°–165°E] KE region\n(right box in Fig. 1b)2,10,20,22–26. Oceanic Rossby waves are also\nclosely linked to low-frequency variations in the southern\nrecirculation gyre intensity and the latitudinal migration of the\nKE\njet2,13,20,29.\nSatellite\naltimeter\nmeasurements\nand\neddy-\nresolving ocean simulations have shown that the positive KE state\n(e.g., above-normal KE SSH anomalies) is accompanied by a\nstrengthened\nsouthern\nrecirculation\ngyre\nand\na\nnorthward-\ndisplaced zonal-mean KE path29.\nLarge-scale oceanic Rossby waves modulate not only the\nphysical characteristics of the WBCs but also the local eddy\nactivity of the KE13,14,20,25,30,31. Interactions between the wind-\nforced and intrinsic eddy variability in eddy-resolving hindcast\nsimulations reveal that the positive (negative) KE state can be\ndescribed as the elongated (contracted) state, where the internal\nocean perturbations are restricted (favored)15,29.

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nAerosols are one of the most important, yet uncertain, factors in\ndetermining the surface energy balance in the Arctic1. They can\ndirectly affect the surface energy budget through scattering and\nabsorption of light (direct radiative effects) and indirectly through\nthe modification of cloud microphysical properties (indirect\nradiative effects)2,3. However, the processes of natural Arctic\naerosols and their effects on the radiative balance are poorly\ncharacterized in global climate models, thus a more complete\nunderstanding of the factors affecting the aerosol burden is\npertinent for the prediction of the future Arctic climate4.\nIn the Arctic, there are strong seasonal variations in aerosol\nparticle number size distributions and concentrations, with long-\nrange transport of accumulation (Acc) mode particles (particles\nwith a diameter (Dp) > 100 nm) in late winter and early spring and\nlocal production of ultrafine (UF) mode particles (Dp < 100 nm) in\nthe summer and autumn seasons5–10. Expansion of the polar\ndome, limited turbulent transfer due to stably stratified atmo-\nspheric layers, and inefficient wet removal in the late winter and\nearly spring allow for the long-range transport and accumulation\nof anthropogenic pollution (e.g., sulfate and black carbon) in the\nlower Arctic11–16, resulting in the Arctic haze phenomenon17.\nDuring the summer, contraction of the polar dome, increase in\nwet removal, and retreating sea ice cause regional sources of\naerosols and precursor gases to become more dominant, which is\nmanifested in an increase in nucleation and Aitken mode particles\nthrough\nnew\nparticle\nformation\n(NPF)\nand\nsubsequent\ngrowth8,18–22. Marine and cryosphere emissions of dimethyl\nsulfide (DMS) and iodine-containing compounds can photoche-\nmically oxidize into low-volatility vapors (e.g., sulfuric acid and\niodic acid), which can initiate new particle formation and undergo\nfurther condensational growth to sizes that can affect cloud\ncondensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations23 and thus the atmo-\nspheric radiative budget indirectly24–26. These emissions have\nbeen shown to proceed under biotic (marine biological activity in\nthe marginal ice zone) and abiotic (photochemically induced\nsnowpack emissions) conditions27,28. Biogenic sources can also\ncontribute to the atmospheric burden of aerosol particles through\nthe direct emission of primary particles, especially in the summer\nmonths29–32.\nChanges in the atmospheric burden of aerosol particles have\nbeen observed within the Arctic.

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nNearly 300 million people worldwide are exposed to annual\nfloods, causing more than US$651 billion loss per year over the\npast two decades1. Flooding triggered by extreme rainfall is\nparticularly frequent and destructive in low-lying and rapidly\ndeveloping tropical regions of Asia and Oceania. The vulnerability\nof the region to extreme precipitation was on display in December\n2020 when widespread flooding impacted southern Thailand and\nIndonesia, killing at least 34 people, damaging 587,100 residential\nhouses, and causing 60 million USD economic loss2. More than 25\nmajor floods or severe weather events causing substantial\ndamage were reported in Southeast Asia and tropical Oceania in\nthe boreal winter season (months from November to April) of\n2020 (ref. 2). The recently released sixth assessment report (AR6,\nref. 3) emphasized that extreme precipitation will likely increase in\nthe tropics under continued global warming, but with consider-\nable regional inconsistency, as well as uncertainty pertaining to\nthe mechanisms triggering extreme rainfall4–6. Meanwhile, the\nParis Agreement aims to reach a net-zero greenhouse gas\nemission target and limit warming below 2 °C of pre-industrial\nlevels7. Uncertainties exist whether the implementation of global\nclimate mitigation strategies, mainly initiated by mid-latitude\ncountries, will have an effect on vulnerable regions of the tropics\nwhere future extreme rainfall is projected to impact greater\npopulations and cause increased levels of damage owing to\nacceleration in the global hydrological cycle1,8.\nThe most important triggering mechanism associated with\nextreme rainfall at intra-seasonal scale over tropical Asia and\nnorthern Australia is the Madden–Julian Oscillation9,10, which is\nthe several-thousand-km envelope of clouds, winds, and rainfall\nthat moves eastwards along the equator with a 20–90 day\ntimescale during the boreal winter season11 (Supplementary Fig.\n1). The MJO induces precipitation anomalies within alternating\nregions of enhanced and suppressed convection12,13. Extreme\nrainfall events may occur when the MJO is in an enhanced\nconvective state that affects weather not only in its immediate\ngeographical location but in areas leading and trailing its\npath14–16. In addition, the MJO affects extratropical regions\nthrough exciting Rossby waves, leading to the far-reached MJO\nteleconnections in the North Pacific and North Atlantic17,18.\nMany studies have made projections on changes in MJO activity\nin a warming climate via Earth System Models (ESMs)13,19–21, but it\nremains unclear how changes in MJO-induced extreme rainfall\nmay influence the societal exposure in response to future\nwarming and climate mitigation attempts22. Such efforts rely on\naccurate simulation of MJO processes in ESMs. However, most\nCMIP5 models largely underestimate MJO amplitude and fail to\nreproduce a coherent eastward propagation of MJO23. Recently,\nsome CMIP6 ESMs have demonstrated substantial improvements\nin simulating the structure of MJO mainly due to the reasonable\nsimulation of horizontal moisture advection over the Maritime\nContinent of tropical Southeast Asia24. These model advances\ncreate an opportunity to address the dynamics of MJO-related\nextreme rainfall and its potential socio-economic consequences in\nthe coming decades.\nHere, using climate model outputs for various global warming\nscenarios, we investigate projected changes in the MJO contribu-\ntion to regional extreme rainfall, along with associated changes in\nthe exposure of population and urban areas in tropical Southeast\nAsia and northern Australia to extreme precipitation during the\nboreal winter seasons when MJO is the most enhanced11,12.

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nPollution prediction in cities with dense populations can be critical\nfor generating fine-grained policy recommendations and public\nhealth warnings1–3. The scale of accurate sensor-based monitoring\nrequired to achieve this can come at a huge cost and thus inhibit\nbuilding a\ndense fine-grained pollution\nsensing\nmap. The\ndeployment of low-cost particulate matter sensors to replace or\naugment reference grade pollution air quality monitoring systems\nhas been studied extensively recently, and have addressed issues\nof calibration4–6, design7,8, data selection9, and personal exposure\nquantification10,11. However, building a highly accurate large scale\nfine-grained pollution sensing and monitoring map that leverages\nthe size of a pollution network has been largely unexplored.\nSpecifically, modeling the behavior of noisy low-cost sensors in\ncities with high pollution and population density has not been\nstudied\npreviously,\nwith\nrecent\nstate-of-the-art\nmapping\napproaches providing errors only in the range of 30–40%12,13.\nThis high error lends the pollution sensing map unusable for\npolicymaking and air quality hazard detection. Prior work on\ndeploying low-cost sensor networks for air pollution have been\nsuccessful on a small scale (within 2 km radius) with high rates of\nagreement for PM 2.5 measurements in Southeastern United\nStates14. Survey studies have shown that there is a necessity for a\nparadigm shift towards crowd-funded sensor networks to enable\nfine-grained sensing-based applications on a large scale15. The\nquestion of calibration issues in such large scale settings has been\nexplored recently with promising results without the need for\nsignificant recalibration16 after well-controlled laboratory calibra-\ntion17. PM 2.5 prediction models recently have explored deep\nneural networks like long-short term memory (LSTM), convolution\nneural networks (CNN), attention-based models; vector regression,\npartial differential equations, but focus on a single unified model\nat a single location, rather than in a large scale sensor network\nsetting18–24.\nRecent work has also explored the use of distributed sensor\nnetworks to gather information on air pollution and other\nmeteorological variables in urban contexts25–29. Clements et al. 30\nprovide a comprehensive review of many such works. Researchers\nhave sought to learn more about how pollution sensing systems of\nlow-cost sensors may be deployed in urban contexts14,31–36. With\nthe exception of Gao et al. 36, who examine the performance of\nfine\nparticulate\nsensors\nin\nXi’an\nin\nChina,\nmost\nof\nthese\ndeployments have occurred in areas with significantly lower air\npollution than the city of Delhi in India. Gao et al. 36 also point out\nthat low-cost PM2.5 sensors may perform worse in very low\npollution environments, suggesting that they may be relatively\nmore useful when particulate concentrations are high. Related\napproaches in this space can be broadly classified into three\ngroups—spatial interpolation approaches, land-use regression, and\ndispersion models Xie et al. 37, Jerrett et al. 38. In the case of\ndispersion models, they assume that an appropriate chemical\ntransport model is identified along with their parameter values,\nand a high-quality emissions inventory. In the case of land-use\nregression models, having access to environmental characteristics\nthat significantly influence pollution is critical.

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nPrimary biological aerosols (PBA) including bacteria, fungi, fern\nand bryophyte spores, viruses, fragments of insects and leaves are\nabundant in the atmosphere and are agents for the spread of\nmicroorganisms and reproductive material, ranging in size from a\nfew nanometers up to several millimeters1–4. In the Amazon, air\nsampling above and below the canopy has shown that fungal\nspores dominate the coarse size range of suspended particles3,5.\nAbout 90% of atmospheric particles <10 µm are composed of\norganic material, irrespective of the season5–8.\nIn a recent wet-season study using fluorescence insitu\nhydridization, coarse PBA were dominated by bacteria and\nEukaryotes, and the largest of these were greatly reduced at\n300 m height. Also, up to 30% of coarse PBA were attributed to\nbiological debris9.\nThe smallest of the suspended particles are mostly secondary\norganic aerosols, known to scatter and absorb radiation and\ninitiate the formation of clouds and precipitation by acting as\ncloud condensation and ice nuclei6,10–13. It also was suggested\nthat a significant part of smaller particles originated from\nprimary emission, i.e., fungal discharge liquids and fragmented\nspores14,15. In tropical regions, the regional circulation pattern\nand evapotranspiration, together with bioaerosols, are impor-\ntant factors shaping hydrological processes16–19.\nThe potential for vertical transport of coarse PBA and the role\nthey might play in cloud formation has been frequently\ndiscussed. Some authors point out that PBA can act as giant\n(usually >10 µm2) CCN in the atmosphere, whereby water\ncondenses on a large particle, producing a tail of large droplets\nwith\nhigh\ncollection\nefficiency,\nenhancing\ncollision\nand\ncoalescence processes, and influencing warm rain forma-\ntion20–22. Thus, it is important to identify the sources and\nmeasure the abundance of coarse PBA that are carried above\nthe rainforest canopy in order to estimate the PBA contribution\nto CCN above the Amazon forest.\nVertical atmospheric lifting is a prerequisite for long-range\ntransport of aerosols and is related to and controlled by\npressure systems, convection and inversion layers23. Coarse PBA\nhave been reported to travel across countries and the ocean,\nbut these are believed to be rare events24. Daily regional\nforecast models for atmospheric pollen abundance still assume\nan even distribution from near ground level to the top of the\natmospheric boundary layer, i.e., to a height of ~1 km above\nground level25–27. However, many studies on the distribution of\npollen grains up to 100 m above ground showed that their\nabundance was well-correlated with specific meteorological\nconditions.25,26,28–31. Using aircraft measurements, high con-\ncentrations of aerosol particles were reported to be transported\nacross the boundary layer by strong convection30. However,\nthere is a paucity of long-term studies on PBA particles at fixed\nheights and especially in tropical regions. In the central Amazon\nrainforest, there are strong updrafts and downdrafts from\nfrequent deep convection events that could influence vertical\nPBA transport.\nIn the current study, we conducted long-term tower-based\nmeasurements at 5 height levels up to 300 m above ground to\nidentify coarse and giant PBA >5 µm in the Amazon rainforest\natmosphere.

Trends in airborne\nconcentrations of nitrate, sulfate, and SOC at sites in southern England are compared with emissions and concentration trends for\nsulfur dioxide (SO2), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), and non-methane VOC, and show some increased ratios of concentrations to\nemissions, strongly suggestive of non-linearity in the primary-secondary pollutant relationships for nitrate, but not the other\npollutants.

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nA decline in the emissions and hence airborne concentrations of\nprimary pollutants will in most cases lead to a reduction in\nconcentrations of related secondary pollutants. However, the\ndecline\nin\nsecondary\npollutant\nconcentration\nmay\nnot\nbe\nproportional to the reduction of its precursor, a phenomenon\nknown as non-linearity. In general, non-linearity works in the sense\nof a less than proportionate decrease in the secondary pollutant,\nand hence it is likely that many secondary pollutant concentra-\ntions will not fall as rapidly as those of their main precursor.\nNon-linearity is well known in gas phase atmospheric chemistry,\nfor example in the oxides of nitrogen-ozone system. In polluted\natmospheres, atmospheric photochemistry leads to net ozone\nproduction from photolysis of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and peroxy\nradical chemistry1. This is most efficient at quite low concentra-\ntions of NO2, as NO2 is a sink for the hydroxyl radical (OH) which\nplays a key role in sustaining the photochemistry in which ozone\nis formed. Hence as NO2 concentrations reduce, at constant levels\nof Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) and sunlight, ozone\nproduction efficiency rises leading to higher concentrations2.\nThe increased OH radical concentration will cause enhanced\noxidation of other compounds such as NO2, SO2, and VOC, leading\npotentially to more nitrate, sulfate, and secondary organic aerosol\n(SOA). This is likely to be a general phenomenon as many species\nsuch as VOC, SO2 and NOx are sinks for atmospheric oxidants, and\nas they reduce in concentration, so oxidants may increase leading\nto faster formation rates of secondary pollutants. There are also\ncases of direct oxidant limitation, in which oxidant availability\nplaces a limit on the amount of a pollutant which can be oxidised,\nand a fall in precursor does not reduce the amount of secondary\nproduct if the precursor still exceeds the available oxidant3.\nThe secondary pollutants which contribute most to PM2.5 mass\nare typically sulfate, nitrate, and secondary organic compounds4,5.\nThe clearest evidence of non-linearity deriving from atmospheric\nmeasurements is for sulfate. Emissions of SO2 in Europe and North\nAmerica have reduced hugely in past decades, and this is reflected\nin lower measured concentrations of both SO2 and sulfate. Jones\nand Harrison6 examined the decline in concentrations at the EMEP\nsites across Europe, finding a far less than linear reduction in\nsulfate relative to SO2. Measurements in North America7 have\nsimilarly shown a less than linear reduction in sulfate. Evidence\nfrom measurements is much weaker for nitrate and secondary\norganic compounds, in the former case due to a much shorter\nhistory of emissions reductions for NOx than for SO2, and in the\nlatter case, the difficulty of making definitive measurements.\nHowever, reduced road traffic emissions during periods of\nlockdown due to Covid-19 have provided an opportunity for\nevaluation of precursor-secondary component relationships8,9,\nalthough these studies are more susceptible to effects of\nvariations in weather than the longer-term datasets. Li et al.10\nshow complex non-linear responses of nitrate aerosol to controls\non NOx emissions in major cities of China, as did Balamurugan\net al.11 in German cities. A recent paper by Pye et al.12 shows a\nhigh degree of linearity between emissions of SO2, NOx, and VOC\nand their ambient concentrations over the period 2002 to 2019 in\nthe United States. The associated model study shows an\ninteraction between pollutants, as well as regional variations in\nsecondary pollutant reductions, which are mostly less than linear.\nNumerical models are the only means of predicting future\nchanges in secondary pollutant concentrations.

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nThe climate crisis is of utmost concern to both the climate science\ncommunity and the public1. The 2015 Paris Agreement has set a\ntarget of limiting the global temperature increase in this century\nto 2.0 oC, while trying at the same time to pursue a more\nambitious target to limit the increase to 1.5 oC. Substantially\ndifferent impacts between the warming of 1.5 and 2.0 oC have\nbeen widely reported2,3. To cope with this unprecedented\nchallenge, effective actions are urgently needed4,5, and reliable\nestimations of climate response to anthropogenic greenhouse gas\nemissions are required.\nThe global climate system has a huge inertia6, delaying the\ntemperature response to changes in greenhouse gas concentra-\ntions. Of the heat resulting from anthropogenic greenhouse gas\nemissions, more than 90% is stored in the ocean7. The ocean can\nin turn affect the air temperatures as well as the entire climate\nsystem in a slow and persistent way. Accordingly, even if no more\ncarbon dioxide were emitted to the atmosphere now, or more\nrealistically speaking, if the target of carbon neutralization were\nachieved, the global temperature may still rise for decades to\nreach an equilibrium state. For instance, for the estimation of the\nEquilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS), thousands of years of model\nsimulations are needed to obtain the ECS8, which requires massive\ncomputational resources, but the estimate would still have a large\nuncertainty attached to it due to structural model issues9,10. Note\nthat a more popular way, compared to the way of running models\nfor thousands of years, is to estimate the ECS from a short, e.g.,\n4 × CO2 climate model experiment assuming the relationship\nbetween the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiative imbalance N and\nthe global mean surface temperature change ΔT is linear as\nN = F −λΔT11. However, the facts that (i) the climate response is\nnonlinear12 and (ii) the feedback parameter λ varies over time\nscales13 make the estimation still challenging. In order to better\ndesign adaptation strategies, understanding how the global\ntemperature reacts to the anthropogenic radiative forcing is an\nurgent issue.\nEver since the middle of the last century, when the “Hurst\nPhenomenon” was discovered14,15, it has been recognized that\nmany climate variables are characterized by long-term climate\nmemory14,16–19, which is relevant for understanding the inertia in\nthe climate system. Different from the short-term memory, which\ndescribes the persistence of a given process on weather scales\n(i.e., a few days to around two weeks), long-term climate memory\ndepicts the scaling behavior of multiple processes of different\ntime scales. This cascade represents how multi-scale processes\naffect each other, i.e., fast processes may force slow processes to\nchange, while slow processes may modulate the variations of fast\nprocesses on a longer scale20. Consequently, time series with\nscaling behaviors are characterized by the persistence of much\nlonger time scales. This property is called long-term memory14.\nBased on the classical Brownian Motion and Random Walk\ntheories, various approaches such as the Fluctuation Analysis\n(FA)21, the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA)22, have been\ndeveloped and widely used over the past few decades to quantify\nthe strength of the long-term climate memory in different climatic\nvariables ranging from surface air temperatures19,23, sea surface\ntemperatures24 and precipitation18, to relative humidity16, sea\nlevel17, and the atmospheric general circulation25. A physically\nunderstandable finding was that the air temperatures of islands\nhave stronger long-term climate memory than those from inner\ncontinents, thus highlighting the impacts of the ocean heat\ncapacity24,26. If large-scale spatially averaged temperatures (e.g.,\nglobal mean surface temperature) are considered, strong climate\nmemory has been reported27, which is in line with the fact that the\nocean may store the heat and release it back to the atmosphere\nslo\n\n[TRUNCATED]",

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nThere is growing concern in relation to the influence of climate\nchange on the natural environment and on human socioeconomic\nactivities. The impacts of climate change extend globally but with\nsubstantial inhomogeneity. Among Earth’s various environmental\nsystems, those that exist in the Arctic and circum-Arctic regions\nhave been affected strongly by rapid warming, which is projected\nto continue at a rate approximately twice that of the global mean1.\nThe enhanced warming in the Arctic region, referred to as Arctic\namplification, is not simply a local issue because it weakens the\nlatitudinal thermal gradient, causing jet meandering that could\npossibly trigger abnormal weather in mid-latitude regions2. The\naccelerated warming in the Arctic is maintained by complex\ninteractive processes that encompass components of the ocean,\nland, and atmosphere. In such interactions, the hydrological cycle\nplays a focal role by regulating ice–albedo feedback and radiative\nenergy transfer3.\nThe issues that remain unexplained with respect to the\nhydrological cycle include the effect of Arctic warming on\ncontinental snowfall. During seasonal transitions, snow cover\npredominantly regulates the surface energy budget. Many earlier\nstudies demonstrated that snow cover exerts a memory effect in\nwhich the signal of a hydrometeorological episode is stored as a\nsnow cover anomaly during the cold season, and that this signal\nre-emerges several months later during the snowmelt season to\nreinforce the atmosphere4,5. Therefore, knowledge of a precursor\nsignal stored as a snow cover anomaly is expected to help\nimprove seasonal prediction of abnormal weather, e.g., the\npotential for modulation of the likelihood of heatwaves6,7 that\nenhance the risk of fire in boreal forests8,9.\nThe recent rapid reduction in Arctic sea ice and evident\nwarming of the Arctic Ocean are likely to increase snow cover over\nnorthern Eurasia10–12. It was revealed that heavy snowfall events\nover Europe are attributable to atmospheric moisture supplied\nfrom the Barents Sea, and that such a mechanism explains the\ndecadal change in snowfall over the Scandinavian Peninsula12. It is\nreasonable to hypothesize that similar pathways of equatorward\nmoisture transport exist across northern Siberia where the\ndistance from the low- and mid-latitude oceans is large. An\nidealized general circulation model experiment predicted that an\nice-free Arctic Ocean would increase the extent of snow cover\nover Siberia10. A Lagrangian moisture transport model showed\nconsistent results, whereby the airmass over the Arctic Ocean\nacquires more humidity in years with low ice cover, which\nincreases precipitation over western Siberia11. Despite these\nearlier\nefforts,\nquestions\nremain\nregarding\nthe\namount\nof\nequatorward moisture transport that originates from the Arctic\nOcean and its change over the decadal timescale. Therefore, the\nobjective of this study was to quantify the fraction of water vapor\nevaporated from the Arctic Ocean, and to investigate its transport\nto northern Eurasia, particularly Siberia, during recent decades\nwhen Arctic sea ice retreat has been remarkable. The analysis was\nconducted using a tagged moisture transport model (“Methods”).\nBecause the model was driven using a reanalysis dataset, we\nattempted to diagnose the reality of the effects of the moisture\nreleased from the Arctic Ocean.\nRESULTS\nDistribution of Arctic moisture along coastal Siberia\nThe simulation was performed for the period 1981–2019.

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nThe impact of anthropogenic emission of trace gases from urban\nareas to biogenic environment is still uncertain, particularly in\nterms of how urban air pollutants can modify the levels of reactive\ncompounds and natural atmospheric chemical pathways1. The\ncomplex interaction between urban and biogenic species can\ninfluence\natmospheric\noxidation\ncapacity2\nand\nmodify\nthe\nproduction and, thereby, ambient concentration of aerosols3–6.\nUnderstanding the changes in the natural atmospheric conditions\ndue to the transport of pollutants from urban areas, particularly\nthe megacities, is essential to accurately describe the influences of\nurbanization on regional atmospheric chemistry.\nA typical approach of evaluating the perturbation of anthro-\npogenic pollutants is to identify and account for the tracers\nassociated with human endeavors. Such an approach is based on\na hypothesis that the ambient concentration of the specific tracers\nincreases with the strength of corresponding activities. Estimating\nthe mass contribution of these tracers in a clean and biogenic\nenvironment where only natural processes partake may provide\nan ideal case to test the hypothesis. Several traditional tracers in\ngas and particle-phase have been effectively characterized and\nattributed to specific sources7–10. For instance, carbon monoxide\n(CO) is produced from the incomplete combustion of fossil/bio\nfuels, which makes it a typical tracer of urban plumes. However,\nthe assessment of CO emission is associated with a large\nuncertainty due to variable sources of CO, which also include\nthe natural biomass burning (BB) and oxidation of biogenic\nvolatile organic compounds (BVOCs)11. Also, potassium ion (K+) is\ncustomarily tagged as a marker of biomass burning (BB) but it also\nhas an apparent contribution from sea spray in coastal areas and\nresuspension of soil from fertilized cropland in agricultural areas.\nBecause of the relatively well-characterized emissions of volatile\norganic compounds (VOCs) from various urban sources, the VOCs\nand their respective oxidation products in aerosols have been\nsuggested as source-specific markers of urban air pollution in the\natmosphere12,13.\nIn this study, the perturbation of anthropogenic processes in a\nsubtropical forest during the fall season of 2015 is evaluated\nthrough a comprehensive characterization of submicron organic\naerosols, which includes analysis of source, size distribution, liquid\nwater content (LWC), pH, and saturation concentration. Although\nseveral studies have previously shown the influence of urban\nemissions on the atmospheric conditions of forest environ-\nments1,3,14, only a handful of observations were implemented in\nbiogenic sites in the East Asia Region that is heavily impacted by\nboth local and regional pollution events. The forested area in this\nstudy is located downwind of the major urban area in central\nTaiwan, where a substantial amount of air pollutants are emitted\nfrom sources like coal-fired power plants, vehicles, and industrial\nfactories. The urban air pollutants are transported to the forested\nsite with the aid of mountain-valley circulation15. Moreover,\nTaiwan is located in the downwind area of East Asian winter\nmonsoons and receives transboundary atmospheric pollutants\noriginating in the Chinese megacities during the cold seasons16,17.\nWith the confounding sources of anthropogenic emissions,\ninvestigation at this forested site can provide direct evidences of\nthe impact of human-related activities on the formation pathway\nof organic aerosols.

Field observations\nhave shown that marine NPF is closely related to the iodine-\nbearing molecules8, which originate from iodine vapors emitted\nby marine algal9,10. Among these iodine components, iodic acid\n(HIO3, IA) has been identified to be the key NPF driver in the\ncoastal, open ocean, and ice-covered polar regions11–13. However,\natmospheric observations of IA cannot be associated with\npredicted particle formation rates14. Given the complexity of\natmospheric components, other widespread precursors over the\noceans, especially from biological emissions, may also be involved\nin the formation process of IA particles.

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nCompound extreme events have been steadily increasing over\nrecent decades, leading to significant environmental and social\nimpacts1–5. For instance, the 2012 drought in the central U.S.,\naccompanied by high-temperature anomalies, cost at least $30\nbillion in large agricultural damage6. The heatwaves have been\ndelivering havoc across Europe in 2022, causing droughts,\nwildfires, and deaths. These compound extreme events could\ncontribute to the onset of wildfires as well as the onset of rapidly\ndeveloping droughts, and their frequency is expected to increase7.\nMoreover, compound temperature and precipitation extreme\nevents have decisive effects on the probability of increased crop\nlosses8. Extreme temperature and precipitation events such as\nheatwaves and droughts have been widely investigated world-\nwide9–11. Therefore, understanding and investigating compound\nheat and precipitation extreme events is critical to mitigating\nsignificant social and economic risks.\nRegional differences in temperature and hydrological variables,\nincluding precipitation, result in disparate spatial patterns for\ncompound extreme heat events12,13. Compound droughts and\nheatwaves (DHW) develop according to the modulation of the\nvariety of land surface fluxes affected by surface dryness, climate\npatterns, and anthropogenic forcing14,15. Relevant large-scale\neffects of external forcing on extreme heat events include net\nincreases in temperature induced by changes in the enhanced\nmoisture content of the atmosphere, radiation, and circulation\npatterns.\nAdditional\nfeedback\nprocesses\nrelated\nto\nland-\natmosphere interactions associated with soil moisture or snow\ncan modulate global changes in extreme heat events10,16–20.\nPrevious studies have shown that dry soil moisture conditions can\nsignificantly affect the severity of heatwaves and droughts by\ncoupling\nthe\nsoil\nmoisture\nand\nthe\natmosphere19,21.\nSoil\nmoisture–temperature coupling could account for heatwaves in\nsummer\nclimates.\nModeling\nexperiments\nhave\nfocused\non\nidentifying strong coupling regions and determining how climate\nchange affects these regions16,22.

There are\ntwo main modes of variability in the Indian Ocean, one is the\nIndian Ocean Basin Mode (IOBM) and the other is the Indian\nOcean dipole (IOD). Both modes modulate the global climate\nvariability on different timescales13–16 and show strong season-\nality. The IOBM is forced by the El Niño-Southern Oscillation\n(ENSO) and peaks in boreal spring following an ENSO event,\nwhereas the IOD peaks and shows maximum variability in boreal\nautumn10. The IOD is defined as the see-saw of the Sea Surface\nTemperatures (SSTs) anomalies between the western and the\nsoutheastern Indian Ocean17. ENSO, through an atmospheric\nbridge, also strongly interacts with the IOD mode18. ENSO\ninfluences IOD due to an anomalous walker circulation, which\ninduces a low-level easterly flow that shallows the thermocline\nover the eastern TIO which, in turn, strengthens the warm pool\nover the western Indian Ocean during a warm ENSO event,\nfavoring the positive IOD phase. The ENSO-IOD relationship peaks\nduring the boreal autumn season16, but still about half of IOD\nvariability can exist independently. Recently, a very strong IOD\nevent developed during boreal autumn and early winter of 2019/\n20, favoring the positive NAO phase during boreal winter that led\nto extreme warm and wet climatic conditions over the North\nAtlantic and European (NAE) region6 and drought-like conditions\nthat led to the extreme fires during the Australian summer season\nin the southern hemisphere19.

As climate warms, it has been projected that TCs may\nmove towards higher latitudes (poleward migration)30–40, how\npoleward migration can impact future TC’s intensification is\ntherefore an important question to ask. Because poleward\nmigration may involve different TC metrics, e.g., genesis location,\nlifetime maximum intensity (LMI) location, intensification track\n(genesis to LMI) or the entire TC track30–40, this research focus on\nthe intensification track.\nAs TCs move towards higher latitudes, one would naturally\nanticipate that poleward migration could negatively impact future\nTC’s intensification, since TCs are also shifting towards a colder\n(less favourable) ocean environment as climate warms. Never-\ntheless, how to quantify this impact is a complex issue. Though\nhigh-resolution climate models simulate the projected intensity of\nTCs and include the effect of poleward migration, this is only one\nof the contributing factors to TC’s intensity change. In other words,\npoleward\nmigration’s\neffect\nis\nembedded,\nbut\nnot\nreadily\nseparable. To separate its effect, a reference case is required,\nsuch that the only difference between the two cases is the effect\nof poleward migration. However, it is challenging to set up that\nproperly in climate model simulations without modifying other\nfactors in such complex models.\nThis research thus proposes to use an alternative approach, the\nPotential Intensity41–45 (PI) approach, to address the issue.\nAs will be shown, the advantage is that both the ‘with’ and\n‘without’ poleward migration cases can be cleanly generated to\nseparate and quantify poleward migration’s effect on future TCs.\nPI is TC’s intensity theoretical upper bound, given the thermal-\ndynamic environmental conditions. Though PI is not the actual\nintensity of TCs, it is the closest possible intensity estimate with\nstrong theoretical underpinning13,41. It has also been suggested to\nbe used as a proxy for the actual intensity as well13. Thus the\ninformation provided is highly relevant, especially understanding\nhow PI may change in the future is by itself important.\nOur study region is the Western North Pacific Ocean (WNP), as it\nis among the global oceans where poleward migration is the most\nevident, in both present-day observation as well as in future\nprojections30–40. The WNP is also the largest TC basin on earth:\n60% of the world’s most intense TCs (i.e., Category-5 TCs) are\nlocated in the WNP46,47.\nBefore proceeding, we first perform a latitude analysis to re-\nexamine the poleward migration over the WNP by the end of the\n21st Century, to ensure that a robust poleward migration\nprojection exists. Three TC track groups are examined. The first\ntwo groups are from the CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison\nProject 5) explicitly-simulated TCs, under the Representative\nConcentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 emission pathways, as\nin Camargo 20135. The third group of tracks is from synthetic TCs\ndownscaled from the CMIP5 RCP 8.5 environmental fields, as in\nEmanuel 20158. The first and the 2nd groups are named C-Track-\n4.5, and C-Track-8.5, respectively, while the 3rd group is named E-\nTrack-8.5. Both C-Track-4.5 and C-Track-8.5 include 6 different\nclimate models, while E-Track-8.5 includes 7 models. Although\nmore models are included in Camargo 20135, some generate too\nfew TCs and their climatology is too different from observations,\ntherefore those models are excluded from analysis (Methods). All 7\nmodels from Emanuel 20158 are considered here.\nAs we are interested in centennial trends, a 10-year low-pass\nrunning filter is applied to remove high-frequency (e.g. inter-\nannual) variability. Additional tests using 5-year and 20-year filters\nare also conducted. We arrange the data according to each\nconsecutive\n10-year\nperiod\ntill\ncentury’s\nend\n(2006–2015,\n2007–2016… 2091–2100).

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nHeatwaves and droughts substantially impact human mortality,\neconomic well-being, infrastructure, and natural ecosystems1–3.\nFor example, the 2003 heatwave in Europe is estimated to have\ncaused more than 70,000 deaths4.

Since 1950,\nmost regions worldwide have observed a significant increase in\nthe number of heatwave days, maximum duration, and cumula-\ntive heat8. Climate model projections estimate that the described\ntrends will continue throughout the 21st century9,10. There is a\nhigh need for operational seasonal forecasts of heatwaves and\ndroughts to mitigate their impacts, e.g., to introduce measures for\nwater\nsaving\nor\nprepare\nnavigation\ninfrastructure\nfor\nlow\nflows11,12. Current forecasts offer limited predictive capabilities,\nunderlining the importance of future studies to increase under-\nstanding of mechanisms causing the events13–15. Identifying\nheatwave patterns allows a meaningful way of dimensionality\nreduction, which is important for further research on driving\nphysical mechanisms for heatwave occurrence.\nCurrent research highlights that heatwaves and droughts are\nhighly interrelated and caused by similar persistent large-scale\natmospheric\ncirculation\npatterns16–18.\nMoreover,\nthe\nself-\nintensifying nature of extreme droughts and heatwaves has been\nsuggested as central to their evolution19–21. There is a two-fold\nrelationship. On the one hand, soil and vegetation dry with the\noccurrence of a heatwave, leading to reduced evaporation.\nTherefore, the likelihood of rainfall decreases, favouring the\nformation of drought20,22. On the other hand, evaporation\ndecreases with the onset of drought. The reduced cloud cover\nleads to a larger fraction of solar radiation reaching the land\nsurface, increasing the likelihood of heatwave formation20,22.\nGlobal-warming-induced changes in thermodynamic conditions\naccount\nfor\n57.3%\nof\nEurope’s\nincrease\nin\nextreme\nheat\noccurrence23.\nThe influence of precipitation and soil moisture anomalies on\nheatwave formation has been studied in different European\nregions. A rainfall deficit in the Mediterranean in spring is found to\nfavour the formation of heatwaves in Northern Europe as the\nrainfall deficit propagates northward throughout the summer16,24.\nA recent study17 confirmed that dry conditions in winter/spring\nseasons prevail prior to hot summers over Southern Europe. Other\nstudies confirm that anomalously dry Western and Northern\nEuropean summers significantly correlate with the occurrence of\nheatwaves\nin\nthose\nregions25.\nSoil\nmoisture\nand\nother\nprecipitation-related\nindices\ncorrelate\nwith\nthe\ntemperature\nextremes in South-Eastern Europe26,27. For the European heatwave\nof July 2019, land-atmosphere feedback and influences of\nnorthward propagation of dryness contributed to the exceptional\nintensity of the event28.\nMost research on heatwaves investigates historical events\nbased on observational data17,24,26,29, which rarely happen by\ndefinition. Moreover, only few studies have analysed generalised\npatterns of heatwaves to derive scientific findings applicable to\ncoherent regions24,29 instead of focusing on the causes of single\nevents30,31.

The current study used observed precipitation, remotely sensed SM, and\nreanalysis of atmosphere and land parameters to assess the East Asian Monsoon (EAM) precipitation variability due to meridional\nSM oscillations across China. A generalized linear method, namely coupled manifold technique (CMT) for assessing the reciprocal\nforcing between two climate fields and numerical simulations are applied to SM and EAM precipitation. We find that the EAM\nprecipitation interannual variability between north and south China significantly correlates with SM meridional oscillation. The CMT\nresults further showed that SM forcing has a significant (99% confidence) influence on the EAM precipitation explaining about 0.40\nof the variance ratio in north and south China. The EAM and SM composite analysis show that the wetter (drier) north (south)\noscillates the EAM precipitation over the north (south) of China and vice versa due to SM thermal controls. We then used control\nand sensitivity simulations with SM observations to further validate the findings implying that SM can potentially improve the\ninterannual EAM forecast skills. The model results show that a wetter (drier) north (south) results in negative (positive) sensible heat\n(latent heat) anomalies that impact the boundary layer and propagate to change the meridional atmospheric heating profile. When\npositive (negative) SM anomalies exist over northern (southern) China, the zonal easterlies and extratropical westerlies move to\nnorth China causing above-normal precipitation that descends into southern China, suppressing subtropical westerlies and\nprecipitation in southern China. On the contrary, a dry (wet) north (south) favors intensified subtropical westerlies and precipitation\nin southern China.

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nThe complex structure of the East Asian Monsoon (EAM) precipitation\nextremes poses direct threats to China’s regional economy and Gross\nDomestic Product (GDP). The EAM complexity lies within its drivers,\nwhich consist of internal feedback between different components of\nthe earth’s climate system, including land1–3, atmosphere4,5, Ocean6,\nand cryosphere7,8. The interannual variability of the EAM could be\nunderstood as a direct space-time precipitation variation between\n(within) the northern and southern major river basins of China forced\nby these factors. The anomalous modes of these driving factors\ninfluence the precipitation extremes that produce floods, droughts,\nand heatwaves with profound socioeconomic impacts9. The severity,\nfrequency, and intensity of floods and droughts may amplify the\nregional losses to $60 billion in capital and many folds attributed to\ndrought under 1.5 and 2 °C warmings6,10,11. The historical EAM\nprecipitation-induced flooding during 1984–2018 cost $19.2 billion,\naccounting for 0.5% of the national GDP and 54% of total weather-\nrelated losses, with an exponential increase from 2006-onward,\naccounting for $25.3 billion10. In >1.5 °C warming of the climate, the\nEAM may intensify primarily due to enhanced land-sea thermal\ncontrast favoring increased continental precipitation12,13.

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nOne important climatic phenomenon that needs to be better\nunderstood is the inter-basin interactions in Earth’s two largest\noceans, the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, which have enormous\nimpacts on various climate and weather phenomena world-\nwide1–4. Much attention has been paid to the interactions\nbetween the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans, which is crucial for\nimproving the credibility of climate change projections and their\nassociated global impacts5–8. The Atlantic–Pacific inter-basin\ninteractions can be specified according to their different time-\nscales. On decadal to interdecadal timescales, Pacific warming\n(cooling) is able to induce Atlantic warming (warming), whereas\nAtlantic warming (cooling) possibly causes Pacific cooling (warm-\ning)7–11. On interannual timescales, the El Niño–Southern Oscilla-\ntion (ENSO) modulates sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs)\nin the North Tropical Atlantic (NTA) in the following spring to\nsummer via extratropical and tropical atmospheric teleconnec-\ntions12–17. In contrast, the SST variability in the NTA can also\nmodulate an ENSO event in the subsequent boreal winter by\naltering anomalous low-level zonal winds over the equatorial\nwestern Pacific via atmospheric teleconnections18–21.\nThe Atlantic–Pacific inter-basin interactions on decadal time-\nscales have been well examined, but those on interannual\ntimescales have not been investigated thoroughly, particularly\nnon-stationary perspectives and their causes. Recent studies have\nshown that the impact of NTA on the ENSO has become significant\nsince the mid-1980s17,21,22, as the climatological mean SST in the\ntropical Atlantic has increased as a result of a positive phase shift of\nthe\nAtlantic\nMulti-decadal\nOscillation\nor/and\nanthropogenic\nwarming22,23. The warmer climatological mean SST in the tropical\nAtlantic promotes an atmospheric response to the SSTA variation,\ncausing an enhanced NTA-ENSO connection. In contrast, the ENSO\nimpact on NTA has weakened since the mid-1980s17,24.\nTherefore, we infer that there are likely two regimes in the\nAtlantic–Pacific inter-basin interactions on interannual timescales,\nwhich has been less examined previously.

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nMajor land regions of the world have been exhibiting severe rise\nin temperature extremes (ExT) during the recent few decades1.\nThe Indian subcontinent has been highlighted as one of the\nhotspots for increased characteristics of ExT2,3. Recent studies\nhave projected that outbreak of high-intensity ExT is likely to\nbecome more common over India at the end of the 21st\ncentury4–8. The Indian region generally experienced the extreme\nheat conditions during the pre-monsoon months of April-May-\nJune9,10, which may elongate into the summer monsoon season as\nwell, due to prolonged deficiency of the monsoon rainfall11–13.\nFurthermore, increase in ExT exerts serious impact on the\necosystem, human health, agriculture and economy14,15.\nUnderstanding long-term changes in ExT over India in past and\nfuture climate has been an important topic of research12,14,15.\nObservations indicate that occurrence of ExT over India is linked to\nlarge-scale atmospheric circulation anomalies and regional-scale\nland-atmosphere feedback processes arising from soil moisture\n(SM) variations16–19. In particular, SM revamps the ExT by\nmodulating the surface energy partitioning and evapotranspira-\ntion (ET)13,20,21. As a crucial component of land-atmosphere\ncoupling processes, SM also acts as temporal storage of atmo-\nspheric anomalies22–25. Additionally, the long-term persisting\nnature (memory) of SM has potential to induce a pronounce\nimpact\non\nnear-surface\ntemperature\nand\nprecipitation\n(PR)\nvariability13,26. Therefore, it is very important to understand the\nregional-scale SM variability using observational datasets and\nmodel simulations to get better insight into land-atmosphere\nfeedback\nprocesses\nassociated\nwith\nextreme\ntemperature\nconditions13,20,27,28.\nThe influence of SM on ExT can be determined using the\nobservational data products13,17,29 as well as state-of-the-art\nclimate model sensitivity experiments initialized by perturbing\nSM30,31. In review of the SM sensitivity experiments over the\nIndian landmass, researchers mostly explored SM-PR feedback\nmechanism using the model simulations32–34. However, impact of\nSM perturbations on ExT over India is still unclear. Therefore, this\nstudy aims to investigate the impact of SM perturbations on ExT\nby using the Meteorological Research Institute (MRI) high-\nresolution (~60 km) atmospheric general circulation model (i.e.\nMRI-AGCM3.235) simulations (refer to sub-section Model and\nexperimental setups for more details) for the historical period\n(1951–2010) and future projection (2051–2100).\nRESULTS\nModel evaluation\nIn this section, we will first evaluate the simulation of some of the\nkey surface hydro-meteorological variables (PR, SM, ET, and\nmaximum temperature: Tmax) over the Indian region from the\nhistorical (HIST) experiment with respect to observed datasets.\nTime-mean (1951–2010) spatial maps of PR, Tmax, SM and ET are\nshown in Fig. 1 from the HIST experiment (1st row) and\nobservational data products (2nd row). While the model simulation\nbroadly captures the spatial pattern of annual mean PR, SM and\nET, such as the relatively higher values over the west coast, north-\ncentral and north-eastern parts of India and lower values over the\nnorth-west India, there are also noteworthy differences between\nthe simulated and observed hydro-meteorological variables. For\nexample, it can be seen that the simulation indicates drier PR,\nlower ET and drier SM over the Indo-Gangetic plains as compared\nto observations.

In the idealized CO2 ramp-up (from 284.7 to 1138.8 ppm) and symmetric ramp-down experiments, SASM\nprecipitation is largely reversible while exhibiting strong asymmetry: it may overshoot the unperturbed level when CO2 recovers.\nSuch asymmetric response is mainly due to the enhanced El Niño-like and Indian Ocean dipole-like warming during the ramp-down\nperiod. The uneven sea surface warming weakens Walker circulation, with anomalous sinking over the SASM region. Meanwhile, the\nwarming also affects the rainfall over the Maritime Continent and tropical western Indian Ocean. The suppressed rainfall over the\nMaritime Continent triggers the equatorial Rossby wave, which weakens the ascent over the SASM region; the increased rainfall\nover the tropical western Indian Ocean excites the equatorial Kelvin wave, which reduces moisture transport. Additionally, tropic-\nwide warming reduces the land-sea thermal contrast and weakens monsoonal circulation. Consequently, the combined effects of\nthe weakened ascent and moisture transport lead to the overshooting of SASM rainfall. Our results suggest that symmetric CO2\nremoval, although unlikely in the foreseeable future, may result in a risk of local drought over the SASM region.",
    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nThe concentration of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere has\nbeen increasing since the Industrial Revolution. It exerts severe,\nwidespread, and irreversible influences on climate and human\nsociety1. To avoid or lower these influences, the Paris Agreement\nproposed a strict target, i.e., holding the increase in the global\naverage temperature to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial (PI)\nlevel and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to\n1.5 °C above PI. Such long-term temperature goals call for\nreaching the global peak of greenhouse gas emissions as soon\nas possible to achieve a climate-neutral world by the middle of the\n21st century. Achieving this target requires Carbon Dioxide\nRemoval (CDR) methods to decrease atmospheric CO2 concentra-\ntion in the future1–6. Due to its huge heat capacity, the ocean acts\nas heat storage which absorbs most of the redundant energy\narising from the CO2 concentration increases1,7. In particular, the\nresponse of the ocean is much slower, with a timescale of decades\nto millennia8–10. If CDR methods are applied, the excess heat\naccumulated in the ocean would affect the climate response\nduring the CO2 ramp-down period11–13. At present, the climate\neffect of CDR is still inconsistent and inadequately understood in\nthe scientific community14,15.\nThe South Asian summer monsoon (SASM), a crucial compo-\nnent of the global monsoon system, directly affects the lives of\nmore than one billion people. Slight changes in SASM precipita-\ntion can cause tremendous socioeconomic impacts, including\nimpacts on agricultural production, water resources, and basic\nhuman needs16,17. Hence, understanding the response of SASM\nprecipitation to climate change is of great importance. Under a\nglobal warming scenario where the CO2 concentration increases\nmonotonically, SASM precipitation is projected to increase in\nnearly all models, despite a weakening of SASM circulation18,19.\nPrevious studies have reported that enhanced atmospheric water\nvapor content and the larger moisture convergence into the SASM\nregion20–23 are responsible for the increased rainfall, which is\nconsistent with the “wet-get-wetter” mechanism24–26. However,\nthe positive contribution of the thermodynamic effect is partially\noffset by the dynamic effect due to the weakened circulation,\nwhich results in a lower increase in SASM precipitation than water\nvapor content27,28. The enhanced upper-tropospheric warming\nover the tropical Indian Ocean29, as well as the mean advection of\nthe stratification change mechanism30, may all contribute to the\nweakened SASM circulation.\nUnder the CDR scenario, SASM precipitation displays an\novershooting relative to that during the CO2 ramp-up period31,\nnamely, SASM precipitation may fully recover and exhibit\ndrought when the CO2 concentration recovers. This is signifi-\ncantly\ndifferent\nfrom\nthat\nof\nthe\nglobal\nhydrological\ncycle12,13,32–35. In the idealized experiment in which the CO2 rise\nis followed by a symmetric decline, global precipitation continues\nto rise for decades after CO2 peaks and cannot return to the\ninitial level when CO2 recovers. Such an asymmetric response of\nglobal precipitation originates mainly from the ocean, and\nprecipitation on land is nearly symmetrical11,36. The response of\nrainfall at the regional scale has a similar response to global\nprecipitation, including the Intertropical Convergence Zone\n(ITCZ)37, East Asia34, and the Korean Peninsula35. For example,\nthe location of the ITCZ changes minimally during the CO2 ramp-\nup period; in contrast, it shifts rapidly to the south during the CO2\nramp-down period and resides in the south when the CO2\nconcentration recovers to the initial level, leading to the\nasymmetric\nresponses\nof\nthe\nITCZ-related\nprecipitation37.\n1State Key Laboratory of Numerical Modeling for Atmospheric Sciences and Geophysical Fluid Dynamics, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing,\nChina. 2Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disaste\n\n[TRUNCATED]",

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nSurface air temperatures and the frequency and intensity of\nextreme heat events are increasing globally and are consequences\nof anthropogenic climate change1–5. The latest Intergovernmental\nPanel on Climatic Change (IPCC) consensus reports that global\nmean temperatures over the first two decades of the 21st century\nwere\n0.99\n(0.84–1.10)\n°C\nhigher\nthan\npre-Industrial\nlevels\n(1850–1900 CE), and they are projected to exceed 1.5 °C above\npre-Industrial levels by 20406. In particular, the last two decades\nshow a substantial increase in extreme summer temperatures\nworldwide7–12. Understanding the spatial and temporal variations\nin the magnitude of these trends is critical because of the intrinsic\ncoupling between climate extremes and ecological and socio-\neconomic systems.\nIn the summer of 2021, the Pacific Northwest region of the\nUnited States (US) and southwest Canada (hereafter the Pacific\nNorthwest; PNW; 42–53 °N, 115–124 °W) experienced a prolonged,\nrecord-breaking heatwave starting in late June and continuing\nthrough early July. This extreme event was associated with an\nomega block atmospheric pattern that focused warmth over the\nPNW and caused daytime temperatures to reach 49.6 °C, increased\nwildfire activity13, elevated rates of heat-related deaths among\nPNW\ncommunities14,\nand\nranks\namong\none\nof\nthe\nmost\nanomalous, extreme heat events ever recorded globally during\nthe observation period15.

In 2021, the PNW also experienced the highest mean\nsummer (June-August; JJA) near-surface air temperatures on\nrecord over the observation period (1950–2021) (Fig. 1). Based\non ERA5 reanalysis data, summer 2021 was approximately +3.6 °C\nwarmer than the 1951–1980 average.\nExtreme temperatures are some of the most significant climate\nimpacts that human populations currently experience6, but\ncommunities around the world have different levels of vulner-\nability and resilience to the consequences of climate change16,17.\nThe timing and location of the PNW heatwave are particularly\nalarming, because none\nof the\nnatural, socioeconomic,\nor\ninfrastructural systems of the normally temperate PNW climate\nare currently adapted to prolonged extreme warmth. The\ninadequate regional infrastructure reflects a social perception\nthat extreme warmth is not a substantial threat in this region of\nNorth America18. Prolonged heatwaves often go unrecognized as\nserious community health threats in temperate locations19, but\nwhen they do occur, indoor facilities are unable to provide heat\nrelief for the most vulnerable populations. Compared to the US\nnational average, significantly less homes in the PNW have\nprimary air conditioning (AC)20. While rates of AC use in British\nColumbia, Canada have nearly doubled in the last decade, as of\n2020, still less than 40% of British Colombians have centralized\nhousehold AC21, indicating a persistent vulnerability to warm\ntemperature extremes. In addition to the immediate societal and\nhealth consequences, the effects of sustained temperature stress\non forest ecosystems are visible across much of the PNW22,23.\nA growing body of literature, using limited observational data\nand modeling to characterize the historic nature of the 2021 PNW\nsummer conditions, shows this event to be highly anomalous and\nof a magnitude with no comparable modern climatic analog24,25.\nRapid attribution suggests that the occurrence of this event would\nhave been virtually impossible without anthropogenic climate\nchange, but because the observed extreme temperatures were so\nfar outside the range of historically observed temperatures (since\nca. 1895), it is difficult to confidently quantify the rarity of the\nevent24.

For instance, residents\nwere reported to have contracted COVID-19 from the air while\nfarming\noutdoors\n(\ncontent_41937765.html, in Chinese). In 2019, BPs that were not\ncompletely inactivated due to expired disinfectant water were\naccidently released from a vaccine factory in Lanzhou, China,\nresulting in the spread of active Brucella virus aerosols into\nnearby urban areas. Consequently, a biosafety incident occurred,\nleaving many people infected with the Brucella virus including\nthe students in the research institute 400 m away as well as\nresidents in the surrounding areas (\nart/2020/9/15/art_4531_928158.html, in Chinese). In addition,\nthe United States and many other countries have also incurred\nterrorist and Bacillus anthracis attacks in their urban cities2.\nEvidently, urban areas with their crowded populations and\ncomplex geographic topology are at high risk of virus transmis-\nsion and unexpected infection. In particular, a formidable\nchallenge lies in predicting and responding to the short-term,\nlarge-scale transmission of infectious BPs released from vaccine\nfactories, wastewater plants, or livestock farms.\nGenerally, computation fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation has\nbeen widely applied in research on urban building ventilation and\npollutant dispersion, with wind tunnel experiments used to\nvalidate the simulation results3,4. Compared with Gaussian and\nintegral models, an advantage to using CFD is that it can account\nfor various meteorological conditions, chemical reactions, and\ncomplex urban environments5,6. It is proven that the aerodynamic\nbehavior of airborne bioaerosols particles (organic or not) around\nbuilding complexes can be well represented via either the\nReynolds-averaged-Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulation approach or\nLarge Eddy Simulations (LES)7–9. In particular, the flow fields\noperating at a urban scale can be reliably expressed by RANS\nsimulations with a low consumption of computation power and\nreasonable\naccuracy\nin\nresolving\nturbulence7,10–12.\nFor\nthe\nmodeling of a pollutant, both Euler and Lagrangian discrete\nphase models have been widely applied, but they often yield\ndifferent results in terms of its dynamic concentration13. An\nidealized urban model was built and numerically simulated using\nthe Euler model to investigate urban ventilation and pollutant\ndispersion under different building densities and aspect ratios14.\nIn other work, a tracer gas was used to replicate the process of a\nvirus leaking from a ventilation shaft and spreading into an\nadjacent tall building15. The simulation results obtained via the\nEuler model are capable of incorporating well the real exposure\nrisks between the adjacent tall buildings. Yet, because there exists\nan interaction force between particles and air, particles could also\naffect the flow field to a certain extent. Meanwhile, the deposition\nof particles on the surfaces of certain buildings should not be\nneglected, especially when an outdoor-to-indoor transmission is\npossible. Accordingly, the Lagrangian particle-tracking model,\nwhich can fully consider the air-particle coupling and track particle\ndeposition, is typically preferred for studying the movement of\nsmoke or BPs. Further, by combining RANS with the Lagrangian\nparticle-tracking model, the rapid prediction of a pollutant’s\ndispersion and deposition with reasonable accuracy can be\nobtained,\nenabling\na\nquicker\nresponse\nto\nurban\nbiosafety\nincidents.\nUnlike most other pollutants, however, the transmission of toxic\nBPs is contagious and pathogenic.

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nThe Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) is the dominant source of\nintraseasonal variability in the tropics1–4 and has profound\nimpacts on weather and climate. MJO activity can modulate\ntropical-extratropical interactions and extreme events in the\nextratropics5,6, tropical cyclone genesis7, and cooling trends in\nthe Antarctic8, among many impacts. Previous work has shown\nthat MJO precipitation amplitude can increase, decrease, or\nremain little changed in climate change simulations, depending\non competing effects of an increased lower tropospheric moisture\ngradient and more top-heavy MJO diabatic heating profile9. In\ncontrast, the change in MJO circulation amplitude is projected to\nweaken or increase at a slower rate than MJO precipitation\namplitude10. Increases in MJO precipitation amplitude have been\nfound in aquaplanet models11, single climate models12,13, multi-\nmodel analyses from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project\n(CMIP) phase 3/5/610,14,15, and also observations16. Projected\nincreases in MJO precipitation and weakening or slower increases\nof MJO wind anomaly amplitude with warming are consistent with\nincreases in dry tropical static stability, which are proportional to\nincreases in tropical sea surface temperature (SST)17. Readers are\nreferred to Maloney et al.18 for more discussion about MJO\nchanges under anthropogenic warming.\nAlthough future changes in the MJO amplitude in response to\nglobal warming are likely, it remains unclear when and how these\nanthropogenic signals will emerge out of the background noise of\nnatural variability. By analyzing the spread derived from a group of\nCMIP5 models, Bui and Maloney (2019b) noted that individual\nchanges in multimodel mean MJO precipitation and circulation\namplitude are only detectable late in the 21st century17. Before\nthen, internal climate variability associated with decadal/inter-\ndecadal climate variations prevents the attribution of MJO change\nsignals to greenhouse gas forcing. However, the authors also\nargued that decreases in the ratio of MJO wind to precipitation\nanomaly amplitude can be detected as early as 2021–2040,\ncontrolled by increases in dry tropical static stability with warming.\nJenney et al. (2021) added that multi-model uncertainty, which\nmay come from the uncertainty in the parameterized moist\nphysics in the model as mentioned by Rushley et al. (2019), also\ncontributes to the uncertainty in future detection of the MJO\ncharacteristics19,20. In addition to the model results above,\nobservational evidence also suggest that detecting MJO changes\nis complicated by interannual-to-multidecadal climate variations\nin the past few decades16,21.\nGiven the challenges in assessing MJO changes in the presence\nof natural variability in the climate system, we will define an index\nthat isolates the global warming signal on the MJO from the\nimpacts of internal climate variability. Our method is closely\nrelated to the concept of time of emergence (ToE), the time when\nchanges in a quantity in response to anthropogenic greenhouse\ngas emissions deviate from natural variability22–26. Using this\nconcept, Mora et al. (2013) showed that mean SST change signals\nemerge earlier in a business-as-usual scenario than a stabilization\nscenario, and unprecedented climates show the earliest emer-\ngence in the tropics regardless of scenario24. On interannual\ntimescales, Ying et al.

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nIn recent decades, the Arctic region has warmed about twice as\nfast as the rest of the globe1. Known as Arctic amplification (AA),\nthis phenomenon is associated with the reduced sea ice and the\nincreased surface air and ocean temperatures in the Arctic\nthroughout the year2–4. Meanwhile, extreme cold winters in the\nmidlatitudes have become more frequent, hence creating the\nphenomenon known as the warm Arctic cold continent (WACC).\nThe subject of WACC has attracted a lot of research attention as it\nprovides\na\nplausible\nexplanation\nfor\nthe\nintensification\nof\nwintertime cold extremes5.\nIn the WACC framework, a fast decline of sea ice and an increase\nin winter SST in the Barents-Kara (BK) Sea is significantly correlated\nwith a colder-than-usual winter climate in Eurasia. In contrast, a\nwarmer east Siberian-Chukchi (ESC) Sea with less sea ice coverage is\nassociated with abnormally cold winters in North America6. Various\ndynamical pathways have been proposed to explain these\nconnections embedded in the intraseasonal time scales, including\nthe weakening of the stratospheric polar vortex7, rapid Arctic\ntropospheric warming8, triggering of mid-tropospheric planetary\nwaves along the midlatitudes and enhanced blocking in Ural\nregions9–11. All these dynamical pathways are thought to have\ncaused\nthe\nmidlatitude\nwinter\nclimate\nto\nbecome\nmore\nextreme12,13. Recent studies suggested that the formation of WACC\nis complex and difficult to attribute, since a wavier pattern of the jet\ncan be entirely caused by the atmospheric internal variability,\nundermining the effect of AA14–20. Despite the ongoing debate, a\nbetter understanding of WACC can improve the seasonal prediction\nof high-latitude climate, considering the importance of this mode in\nshaping weather and climate extremes in these regions.\nThis paper builds on the observed linkage between the Arctic and\nmid-latitude regions on synoptic scales over the past decades. It\nexplores its historical and projected changes under current and 1.5-\nand 2.0-degrees warming scenarios as determined by the Paris\nAgreement as the critical threshold to limit the strength of global\nwarming. We analyze the Half degree additional warming, prognosis\nand projected impacts (HAPPI), a relatively new model projection\ndataset that has an advantage in assessing the impacts of 1.5- and\n2.0-degrees warming on the world’s weather21. Through this analysis,\nwe assessed how WACC will vary through the synoptic linkage under\ndifferent global warming scenarios, as well as identifying what the\nleading factor is in determining the dynamical changes.\nRESULTS\nArctic-midlatitude relationships in observations\nTo establish the baseline for the association between the\nmidlatitude and Arctic synoptic activities, we followed Kug et al.\n(2015) to examine the WACC patterns by conducting the\nregression analysis in two regions: BK Sea with East Asia and\nESC Sea with North America. The regression coefficient between\nthe BK (ESC) Sea and East Asia (North America) for each winter is\nshown as a time series in Fig. 1c, d.

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nHeatwaves are typically defined as rare or unusually warm events\nfor a given location and time of year, that exceed a specific\ntemperature threshold for several consecutive days. The threshold\nthat would classify a meteorological event as an extreme\nheatwave is therefore location-specific and varies around the\nglobe. Due to climate change, thresholds for extreme temperature\nevents are being redefined: for example, in 2022, the UK Met\nOffice switched to using warmer 1991–2020 climatology for\ndefining extreme temperature departures1. While the regional\nthresholds for classifying an event as an extreme heatwave are\nbecoming higher, the human body’s physical thresholds of\ntolerance to heat remain constant (i.e. there has been no evidence\nof a recent evolutionary adaptation that would allow humans to\nwithstand or survive higher heat stress levels than before).\nFrom ‘climate’ and ‘epidemiological’ perspectives, heatwaves\nare most commonly investigated using near-surface air tempera-\nture, also referred to as dry-bulb temperature. Traditionally,\nclimate studies investigating future changes in extreme heat-\nwaves used projections of maximum daily temperatures2–7,\nderiving various statistical indicators related to the magnitude,\nfrequency or duration of the temperature-defined heatwaves.\nLikewise, meteorological maps used by the media to commu-\nnicate forthcoming and ongoing heatwaves most commonly show\nthe\nexpected\nsub-daily\nor\ndaily\nmaximum\ntemperatures8,9.\nEpidemiological studies investigating the links between the\nheatwaves and mortality use the near-surface air temperature as\nthe key climate predictor for explaining heat-related outcomes10.\nFrom a physiological perspective, however, changes in tempera-\nture alone are not considered sufficient to explain the stress that a\ngiven extreme warm weather event can exert on the human body.\nThis is because meteorological factors like the humidity of the\nsurrounding air, the prevailing wind conditions and the length of\nprevious thermal exposure can all have a large impact on how a\ngiven heatwave affects human health and the dangers it is likely\nto pose. For example, an air temperature of 37 °C can be perceived\nas uncomfortable for humans in low humidity, but in combination\nwith high humidity and no wind, it creates conditions under which\nthe human body cannot cool down, thereby potentially posing\ndetrimental health risks.\nWith\nthe\naim\nof\nrelating\nthe\nimpact\nof\nmeteorological\nconditions on the human body and defining the limits dangerous\nfor human health, the climate - health community has focused on\nthe development of a number of heat-stress indices – humidex\n(Hu), apparent temperature (AT), wet bulb globe temperature\n(WBGT), heat index (HI) and universal thermal climate index (UTCI),\namongst others - that incorporate the impacts of several\nmeteorological variables (most notably humidity) in their assess-\nment of associated health risks11–13. However, one of the major\ndifficulties in characterizing dangerous heatwave conditions arises\nfrom the fact that it is not possible to conduct controlled\nexperiments on a wider population that would investigate the\nonset of the most dangerous health outcomes under extreme\nheat conditions. The scientific community has thus often had to\nrely on using actual heatwave occurrences to try to extract such\ninformation14. Critical thresholds have also been suggested based\non\nthe\nlaws\nof\nphysics.\nFor\nexample,\nat\n35 °C\nwet-bulb\ntemperature (WBT), evaporation is not possible and cooling\nthrough sweating would not be effective, leading to the\nsuggestion that this is the upper threshold for human survival in\nhumid heat15. However, a recent study that carried out several\ncontrolled experiments on human response to heat concluded\nthat a physics-only definition leads to a substantial overestimation\nof human health thresholds.

Considering natural\nbaseline or natural background emissions in grazing systems has important implications in the analysis of global food systems.",
    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nLivestock-mediated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are consid-\nered a large causative agent of climate change, with up to 3.75 Gt\nCO2-eq emitted yearly1. A large part of them is attributed to low-\ninput livestock systems in regions with vast savanna landscapes,\nwith Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia specifically accounting for\n0.68 (18% of livestock GHG) and 0.73 (20% of livestock GHG) Gt\nCO2-eq, respectively1.\nNatural rangelands, including savannas, store large amounts of\nsoil carbon and have the capacity to act as carbon sinks,\nespecially when restored from degraded states. However, the\ncurrent emissions attributed to livestock are considered to exceed\nthe mitigation capacity of rangeland soils2. The bulk of direct GHG\nemissions attributed to livestock consists of methane (CH4)\nproduced during the enteric fermentation in the rumen and\nCH4 and nitrous oxide (N2O) released by manure, so that grazing\nlivestock is considered an intense GHG emitter3. Following the\nidentification of CH4 as a good target for quick and effective\nclimate action, more than 100 countries agreed to drastically\nreduce emissions at the recent UN Climate Change Conference\n(COP26) in Glasgow4. Such policy guidelines inevitably lead to\nrecommending the abandonment of livestock grazing in vast\nrangeland areas, which would be subjected to rewilding5, both\nfor the assumed potential of reduction in CH4 emissions and for\nthe potential sequestration of carbon once herbivory is drastically\nreduced6. These calls are not exclusive to high-income countries\nbut extend to countries with very significant livestock popula-\ntions, most notably India—the largest livestock CH4 emitter\nworldwide1—where the abandonment of traditional animal\nhusbandry is proposed7.\nGrazing livestock and wild herbivores occupy similar ecologi-\ncal niches, raising the question whether abandonment of\npastoralism would necessarily lead to a significant reduction of\nemissions8. Large herbivores attain biomass densities in wild or\nrewilded landscapes that are particularly high in Sub-Saharan\nAfrica and, to a lesser extent, South and South-East Asia9. There,\nunlike in other areas, guilds of large herbivores have been\npreserved up to the present. Recolonization of abandoned\nrangelands by large herbivores is thus likely to reach very high\ndensities10, and such wild fauna can potentially attain high levels\nof GHG emissions8. In order to check for the relevance of this\nprocess of herbivore substitution, the hypothesis needs to be\ntested with current field data comparing analog ecosystems\ngrazed by livestock and wildlife.\nIn this study, we aimed to analyze the scenario of a tropical\nsavanna landscape where grazing livestock has dominated for\nmany decades11, but which has the potential to be rapidly\nrecolonized by wild herbivores in the case of abandonment. To\nexamine the contribution to global warming from animals in\nwildlife-dominated\nvs.\nlivestock-dominated\nlandscapes,\nwe\nselected two adjacent areas in Northern Tanzania (Fig. 1) for\nwhich enough data are available to establish a comparison. We\ncalculated the GHG emissions per unit area in the Serengeti-\nMara ecosystem, a large, 25,000 km2 wilderness area dominated\nby migratory wildebeest as grazers and elephants as browsers.\nWe compared them with the adjacent Loliondo Game Controlled\nArea (GCA), an agricultural land essentially belonging to the\nsame savanna ecosystem but being almost exclusively used by\nMaasai pastoralists.\nCurrently, there are still considerable limitations to estimate\nGHGs from animals in free-range conditions, especially with\nregard to their enteric CH4 output. In an attempt to capture the\nvariability associated with the calculation method, we applied\nfive different approaches to estimate GHGs from herbivore\nanimals (Supplementary Table 1), based mainly on the recent\nIPCC guidelines12, refs. 13 and 14.\nOn average from the five different calculation approaches\n(Fig. 2), the wildlife area (Serengeti-Mara ecosystem) showed\nsi\n\n[TRUNCATED]",

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nThe El Niño and Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the dominant\nmode of the tropical air-sea coupling system1–4, featured by large\nsea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the tropical central\nand eastern Pacific, and accompanied by notable changes in the\ntropical\natmospheric\ncirculation\nand\nconvection.\nENSO\nhas\ntremendous impacts on the climate, agriculture, ecosystems,\nwater resource and the livelihoods of people worldwide5–10.\nTherefore, identifying the factors leading to the occurrence of\nENSO events and improving the prediction skill of ENSO are of\ncritical importance.\nThe prediction skill of ENSO is found to decrease obviously since\nthe late-1990s11,12, corresponding to the time when the central\nPacific (CP) type of El Niño has become more frequent13–15.\nExtratropical atmospheric forcings over the North Pacific, particu-\nlarly the North Pacific Oscillation (NPO, the second Empirical\nOrthogonal Function [EOF] mode of sea level pressure anomalies\n[SLP] over the North Pacific)16, are suggested to contribute\nsignificantly to the occurrence of the CP ENSO via the seasonal\nfootprinting mechanism and trade wind charging mechan-\nism17–25. However, two recent studies indicated that the impact\nof the winter NPO on the following winter ENSO weakens largely\nafter the late-1990s26,27, suggesting that extratropical atmospheric\nvariability related to the winter NPO cannot totally explain the\nrecent increased emergence of the CP ENSO.\nThen, what might be other sources of atmospheric variability\nover the North Pacific that contributed to the recent frequent\noccurrence of CP ENSO events? This study finds that the early-\nspring (March) Aleutian Low (AL) may play an important role\nthough prevailing view generally suggested a marked impact of\nthe ENSO on the AL rather than the opposite effect6,28,29. The AL\nintensity variation represents the first leading mode of atmo-\nspheric variability over the North Pacific and explains more\nvariance than the NPO18 (Supplementary Fig. 1). A recent study\nhas preliminarily recognized that variation in the early-spring AL\nintensity has a marked impact on the following winter ENSO\naccording to multiple reanalysis and observational data over 1979-\n201630. However, whether the recent increased occurrence of CP\nENSO after the late-1990s is related to the impact of the early-\nspring AL remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that the\nimpact of the early-spring AL on the following winter ENSO shows\na marked enhancement after the late-1990s.

This minimum is\nwidely attributed to the descending branch of the Eulerian Hadley cell. This study however shows that the precipitation distribution\naligns more closely with the transformed Eulerian mean (TEM) vertical motion. In Northern Hemisphere winter, maximum TEM\ndescent (ascent) and precipitation minimum (maximum) are collocated at ~20°N (~40°N). The subtropical descent is mostly driven\nby the meridional flux of zonal momentum by large-scale eddies, while the midlatitude ascent is driven by the meridional flux of\nheat by the eddies. When the poleward eddy momentum flux is sufficiently strong, however, the secondary precipitation peak\nshifts to 60°N corresponding to the location of the TEM ascent driven by the eddy momentum flux. Moisture supply for the\nprecipitation is aided by evaporation which is enhanced where the TEM descending branch brings down dry air from the upper\ntroposphere/lower stratosphere. This picture is reminiscent of dry air intrusions in synoptic meteorology, suggesting that the\ndescending branch may embody a zonal mean expression of dry air intrusions. Moist air rises following the TEM ascending branch,\nsuggesting that the ascending branch may be interpreted as a zonal mean expression of warm conveyor belts. This study thus\noffers a large-scale dynamics perspective of the synoptic description of precipitation systems. The findings here also suggest that\nfuture changes in the eddy momentum flux, which is poorly understood, could play a pivotal role in determining the future\nprecipitation distribution.",
    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nPrecipitation variability has received considerable attention because\nprecipitation or lack thereof has a large societal impact. An improved\nunderstanding of precipitation variability requires a firm grasp of\nhow the climatological mean state arises. It is well established that\nmost of the cold season extratropical precipitation is associated with\nextratropical cyclones, and the precipitation maximum near 40°N in\nmidlatitudes (bottom panels in Fig. 1) is attributed to extratropical\nstorm activities1,2. Figure 1a shows that the precipitation minimum\nin the subtropics is not caused by a lack of moisture because the\nspecific humidity is greater in the subtropics than in midlatitudes.\nInstead, the precipitation minimum is commonly attributed to the\nclimatological high-pressure systems that form under the descend-\ning branch of the Hadley cells.\nComparing the precipitation distribution with the Eulerian\noverturning circulation (Fig. 1b), however, we see that the\nprecipitation minimum peaks at ~20°N, while the descending\nmotion, measured by ω500, is strongest at ~30°N. Figure 1c shows\nthat the precipitation minimum instead aligns more closely with\nthe downward mass transport of the residual mean circulation of\ntransformed Eulerian mean (TEM) theory3,4. The TEM is different\nfrom the Eulerian overturning circulation in that the former\nincludes a mass transport by the eddies as well as by the zonal\nmean Eulerian overturning circulation. Moreover, the precipitation\nmaximum at ~40°N roughly coincides with the ascending branch\nof the residual mean circulation in midlatitudes. These descending\nand ascending branches form the U-shaped dip (for conciseness\n“dip” hereafter) in the TEM overturning circulation (Fig. 1c). (Note\nthat unrealistically large TEM streamfunction values below 850\nhPa are due to a weak static stability near the surface5, which may\nbe remedied by replacing the singular static stability in pressure\ncoordinate by isentropic static stability near the surface6.) Here, we\nformally define the dip as the region bounded by the maximum\ndownwelling and upwelling\nω\u0001\n500\n\u0001\n\u0003\n, as indicated by the red\nvertical lines in Fig. 1c. From this definition, we see that the dip\nranges between ~25°N and ~40°N. The dip remains robust when\nthe level of the vertical velocity is varied from 500 hPa to 700 hPa.\nUsing a two-layer model, Robinson7 first pointed out that eddy\nmomentum flux (EMF) convergence drives a TEM dip. This is\nconsistent with the “downward control” mechanism in which the\ndistribution of the full EP flux divergence aloft determines the\nvertical motion at lower levels8. The portion of the TEM circulation\ndriven by the EMF contribution (Fig. 2a) exhibits sinking motion\ncentered at ~30°N (Fig. 2d) (calculation described in Materials and\nMethods), a latitude where the TEM circulation shows sinking\nmotion but is located ~5° north of where the sinking motion is\nstrongest. However, the EMF-driven rising motion is centered at\n~60°N (Fig. 2d), and it is eddy heat flux (EHF) divergence (Fig. 2b)\nthat drives the ascending branch of the dip at ~40°N (Fig. 2e). The\nsum of the full eddy flux forcing (Fig. 2c) captures the overall\nstructure of the TEM circulation (compare Fig. 1c and Fig. 2f),\nalthough some discrepancies can be observed in the tropics and\nsubtropics where impact of tropical convection cannot be\nignored9. This analysis indicates that the rather narrow climato-\nlogical dip, ranging between 25°N and 40°N, arises from the\ncombined effect of the two eddy fluxes. The sinking branch driven\nby the EMF (30°N) is compensated by the EHF-driven rising\nmotion,\nresulting\nin\nthe\nTEM\ndownward\nmotion\nbetween\n20°N–30°N. Similarly, the latitudinal location of the rising branch\nis also determined by the relative strength of the two eddy fluxes.\nTo the extent that precipitation coincides with the rising/sinking\nbranch of the dip, it follows that the relative strength of the two\n1Ewha Womans University, Seoul, South Korea. 2The Pennsylv\n\n[TRUNCATED]",

Previous studies have\nclassified heatwaves into independent daytime, independent nighttime, and compound daytime-nighttime types, and examined\nthe long-term changes in the three types.

Here we present the first investigation of the local physical processes associated with\nthe daytime, nighttime, and compound heatwaves over the global land during 1979–2020. The results show that three heatwave\ntypes occur frequently and increasingly in most regions worldwide. Nighttime and compound heatwaves exhibit stronger increases\nin both frequency (the yearly number of the events) and fraction (the ratio of the yearly number of one heatwave type to the total\nyearly number of all types) than daytime heatwaves. Composite diagnostic analyses of local meteorological variables suggest that\ndaytime heatwaves are associated with increased solar radiation under dry conditions and reduced cloud cover and humidity under\na clear sky. In contrast, nighttime heatwaves are typically accompanied by moist conditions with increases in cloud fraction,\nhumidity, and longwave radiation at night. These synoptic conditions for daytime and nighttime heatwaves are combined to\ncontribute to compound heatwaves. Local divergences and moisture fluxes responsible for different heatwaves are further\nrevealed.

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nHeatwave hazards are prolonged extremely hot weather events\nthat can severely damage the environment, human health, and\nsocioeconomic development1–4. For example, the severe Eur-\nopean heatwave in 2003 caused over 70,000 deaths and\nenormous losses in agricultural production5. The 2010 Russian\nheatwave accompanied by drought conditions and forest fires\nresulted in 54,000 deaths6,7. It was observed that heatwaves have\nintensified over the past decades, in terms of their magnitude,\nfrequency, and duration8,9. Under global warming, heatwave\nevents are projected to be further exacerbated and may produce\nmore harmful consequences on human society10,11. Heatwave\nevents have attracted much attention from the public and\nscientists, and have become an essential research topic in recent\nyears12–14. For example, Perkins-Kirkpatrick and Gibson15 con-\ncluded that heatwave duration is projected to increase by 2–10\ndays per degree celsius, with larger changes over lower latitudes.\nRecent studies by You et al.16,17 based on multiple definitions\nreported substantial increases in heatwave activities and extreme\ntemperatures in China over the past decades. Luo et al.18 found\nthat heatwaves in arid Northwest China exhibit significant\nintensifying trends in terms of increasing frequency, prolonging\nduration, and strengthening intensity.\nThe characteristics of heatwaves explored by previous studies\nare mainly based solely on daytime maximum temperature\n(Tmax)18–20. While nighttime heatwaves characterized by a high\ndaily minimum temperature (Tmin) have a significant effect on\nhuman comfort and inhibit the relief from nighttime cooling, thus\npossibly increasing threats to human health21–23. More hazardous\nconditions will emerge when extreme daytime temperatures are\ncombined with the following warm nighttime for consecutive\ndays (i.e., compound heatwaves)22–24.

It is necessary to distinguish different\nheatwave types and reveal the involved physical mechanisms.\nAtmospheric conditions leading to daytime heatwaves have\nbeen well understood in the literature. One major factor causing\ndaytime heatwaves is the anomalous anticyclonic circulation in\nthe middle and upper troposphere, which generates subsidence\nand warm advection8,27–29. The subsidence associated with\nwarming high-pressure anomalies prohibits cloud formation\nresulting in clear skies, thus enhancing the surface shortwave\nradiative heating and prolonging hot conditions30. For example,\nLuo and Lau31 pointed out that heatwaves in southern China are\naccompanied by anomalous anticyclones and high pressure near\nthe surface, resulting from the westward extension of the western\nNorth Pacific subtropical high (WNPSH). On the other hand,\nanomalous anticyclones can suppress convective activities, such\nthat forms a drier and hotter soil environment in favor of the\noccurrence of heatwaves, as reported by Deng et al.32.

(2004) that set the\nfoundations of this new research area11, was motivated by the\ndeadly European summer heatwave of 2003 that claimed the lives\nof 35,000–70,000 people12. Since then, further studies have shown\nhow anthropogenic forcings influence not only heatwaves, but a\nrange of different types of extremes, as well as climate change\nimpacts13. Continuing warming is expected to further exacerbate\nrisks, exposing billions of people to climatic conditions never\nexperienced over the last 6000 years14. Our study aims to offer\nnew insights into the looming reality of temperatures that would\nnot only break new records, but also, in the absence of effective\nadaptation, could usher in calamitous socio-economic conse-\nquences. Dangerous temperature thresholds in terms of local\nimpacts are sometimes easy to identify. For example, after\nreaching a record temperature of 38.7 °C in Cambridge in July\n2019, the possibility of exceeding 40 °C in the UK, which would\nhave been unthinkable a generation ago, began to appear within\nreach. An attribution study indeed confirmed that the chances of\nsuch an event are increasing so fast because of human influence,\nthat it could become common by the end of the century15. Only\ntwo years after the study was published, a new UK record was set\nat 40.3 °C16. Recent studies have also affirmed that Europe needs\nto brace itself for summers hotter than 200317,18. Extreme heat\nposes greater challenges to communities that are more vulnerable\nbecause of their lower adaptive capacity. In Latin American cities,\nfor example, it is estimated that nearly a million of deaths during\n2002–2015 are linked to temperature extremes19. Even in hot\ncountries like India, when one might expect the population is well-\nadapted to high temperatures, extreme heat still takes its toll. For\nexample, during a persistent hot spell in Gujarat in May 2010,\nexcess mortality was found to have increased by 43%20.\nThe raft of adverse impacts associated with extreme heat makes\nit imperative to understand how human climatic influences\nchange their characteristics. The strong links between extremely\nhigh temperatures, a major contributor to heat stress, and excess\nmortality have been well-documented21,22. Such impacts are\nexacerbated in cities because of the urban heat island effect6. The\nincreasing frequency of extremes would also lead to a shift in\ndiseases23. Moreover, high temperatures have been shown to be\ndetrimental to mental health24 and associated with an increase in\nthe risk of suicide25. Excessive heat stress in hot ambient\nconditions has also been shown to reduce productivity and put\na strain on occupational health26. Nevertheless, a billion outdoor\nworkers are estimated to be exposed to extreme heat, with a third\nof them suffering ill health as a result6. As the climate continues to\nchange, hotter regions are projected to bear most of the burden\nof heat-related health impacts in coming decades27. While the UK\npublic is concerned about crossings of the 40 °C threshold28,\nhotter countries face the challenge of overshooting the more\nperilous threshold of 50 °C more frequently, or even for the first\ntime in coming years. Here we use exceedances of t\n\n[TRUNCATED]",

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nAfrica is developing rapidly, with rapid population growth,\neconomic growth, and urbanization1. The African Union’s Agenda\n2063, the ‘Africa We Want’, articulates a vision for development\nwhere people have improved and sustainable livelihoods, live in\nclean environments with low air pollution, and where Africa\nensures that it is climate resilient. Though African countries aim to\nplay their role in limiting global climate change, as evidenced by\ntheir latest NDC submissions, the perception is that local efforts to\naddress climate change are almost entirely about adaptation. This\nis because local mitigation is expected to have little impact on\nAfrican climate change given that Africa emits less than 4% of\nglobal (2020) CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and industry2.\nCooling aerosols, including sulfates, ammonium, nitrates, and\norganic carbon, contribute to local air pollution and currently\nmask a portion of the warming from increased greenhouse gases\n(GHGs). Removal of these aerosols, either due to policies to\nimprove air quality or to mitigate climate change, can thus have\nboth beneficial and detrimental effects on society via changes in\nboth air quality and climate. There is a large body of literature on\nthe so-called ‘climate penalty’ attributable to reductions in cooling\naerosols that unmask greenhouse gas warming3–5. For example,\naerosol reductions that were implemented for the sake of air\nquality have contributed to observed local warming in the US6,\nEurope7 and China8. Although an instantaneous, global removal of\nall cooling aerosols would lead to a sharp rise in global warming3,\na realistic phaseout of fossil fuel usage would only lead to a\nmodest ( ~ 0.02-0.10 °C) warming9. The knowledge that climate\nmitigation can lead to near-term warming has led some to a focus\non strategies that prioritize the rapid reduction in emissions of\nshort-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs), the strategy promoted by\nthe Climate and Clean Air Coalition. Adoption of both sustainable\ndevelopment and SLCP reduction strategies provides a pathway\nfor near-term mitigation of both warming and drying10,11.\nThe climate scientific community continues to highlight the\ntemperature penalty associated with the aerosol decreases that\naccompany GHG reductions. For instance, the latest Intergovern-\nmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report’s Summary for\nPolicy Makers highlights this ‘climate penalty’, stating that “In the\nlow and very low GHG emissions scenarios, assumed reductions in\nanthropogenic aerosol emissions lead to a net warming”12.\nSimilarly, that report’s Frequently Asked Question 6.2 shows how\nemission reductions lead to one or more of four outcome\ncategories: climate benefit, crop benefit, health benefit, and\nclimate penalty, with reductions in cooling aerosols leading to\nhealth benefit and climate penalty impacts only. As Africa has a\nparticularly large ratio of aerosol to CO2 emissions, the climate\npenalty in response to African decarbonization might be expected\nto be especially large.\nHowever, changing temperatures are only one aspect of climate\nchange, and aerosols are known to also play an important role in\nregional precipitation changes13–16. Although many studies have\nexamined the influence of changing aerosols over Europe, North\nAmerica, and Asia, few have explored the role of African\naerosols17. The local impacts of reduced African aerosol emissions\nmay be especially important because the role of African green-\nhouse gas emissions relative to other regions is minor. Therefore,\nAfrica’s large aerosol emissions may have relatively greater\ninfluence on local future climate change than aerosol emissions\nreductions in other parts of the world. Additionally, the cooling\naerosol changes could be particularly large as they include not\nonly sulfate aerosols associated with coal-fired power plants and\nvehicles as in many other parts of the world, but also large\nquantities of organic carbon aerosols primarily from solid biofuel\nuse18. \n\n[TRUNCATED]",

Here we present convergent empirical and\nmodelling evidence to show that the record-breaking Pakistan rainfall, along with the 2022 tripe-dip La Niña, produces anomalous\nhigh pressure over YRV, causing intense heatwaves. The La Niña-induced second-highest sea surface temperature gradient in the\nequatorial western Pacific suppresses western Pacific convection and extends the subtropical high westward.

The overlay of the two high-pressure systems\nsustains sinking motion and increases solar radiation reaching the ground, causing recurrent heat waves.",
    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nIn recent years, heatwaves have become more frequent and\nintense over East Asia1, such as the heatwaves over the Yangtze\nRiver valley (YRV) in 20132, North China in 20183, and South China\nin 20204. Heatwaves usually concur with high-pressure circulation\nsystems. The induced descending motion leads to decreased\ncloud cover aloft and increased downward solar radiation at the\nsurface, which favors heatwave occurrence5,6. As the major high-\npressure system frequently controlling the YRV in midsummer, the\nwestern Pacific subtropical High (WPSH) is critical for heatwave\nformation, especially over its middle and lower reaches2,7,8.\nMoreover, the upper-troposphere South Asia high (SAH) can also\nstrengthen and maintain heatwaves over the YRV by promoting\ndescending motion9,10. The westward expansion of the WPSH\noften accompanies eastward expansion of the SAH. This coupling\nappears to be caused by the SAH-enhanced middle-lower\ntropospheric divergence and zonal temperature gradient over\nsubtropical East Asia11,12.\nPrevious studies have indicated the roles of tropical sea surface\ntemperature (SST) forcing in modulating the WPSH. The tropical\nNorth Atlantic warming may induce a zonally overturning\ncirculation anomaly with anomalous descent over the tropical\ncentral Pacific, which acts to enhance the WPSH via triggering a\nRossby wave response13–15. The Indian Ocean warming emanates\nthe eastward Kelvin waves to the western North Pacific (WNP),\nwhich can suppress the convection and enhance the WPSH via the\ncoupled Indo-western Pacific Ocean capacitor16. More importantly,\nthe El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) plays a crucial role in the\ninterannual variations of WPSH through air-sea interactions17–20. In\nparticular, Wang et al. (ref. 21) emphasized two leading modes of\nlow-level WPSH. The first mode is maintained by positive\natmosphere-ocean feedbacks with the Indian Ocean warming\nand WNP cooling to prolong the effect of the wintertime El\nNiño16,17,22, named as an atmosphere-ocean interaction mode23.\nThe second mode reflects an enhanced WPSH forced by the\nsummertime La Niña, regarded as a La Niña-forced mode19,24,25.\nBesides the tropical SST forcing, the extratropical atmospheric\nteleconnections in the mid-upper troposphere originating from\nNorth Atlantic and Eurasia can propagate to East Asia and impact\nthe summer climate15,26–29. For example, the positive Scandina-\nvian pattern propagates from the Scandinavian Peninsula across\nRussia to East Asia30, which leads to high-pressure anomalies and\nmore heatwaves in North China31. As for YRV heatwaves, the roles\nof the Silk Road pattern32 and the circumglobal teleconnection\n(CGT) pattern33 have been highlighted6,15,31, where the Silk Road\npattern is considered to be part of CGT. The CGT is characterized\nby a wavenumber-5 structure over West Asia, East Asia, North\nPacific, North America, and West Europe33. The CGT’s action center\nover East Asia can displace the East Asia westerly jet northward,\npromoting a northeastward extension of the SAH and a westward\nexpansion of the WPSH8,12,34. It is widely accepted that the Indian\nsummer monsoon (ISM) rainfall is a key factor in exciting the\nCGT33,35,36. The diabatic heating source released by the anomalous\nrainfall can excite an upper-level Rossby wave high over central\nAsia37,38, enhancing the CGT pattern downstream along the\nwesterly jet-induced waveguide.\nIn 2022, high-intensity and long-lasting heatwaves hit the YRV\nin the midsummer (July and August) (Fig. 1a, b). The anomalous\nsurface\nair\ntemperature\n(SAT)\nand\nheatwave\ndays\n(HWDs)\naveraged over the YRV (26°N–34°N/100°E–122°E) have reached\n2.42 K and 23.12 days, respectively. The total number of heatwave\ndays exceeds the climatology by four standard deviations (Fig. 1c).\nAccording to statistics from the Ministry of Emergency Manage-\nment of China, the induced drought disasters have affected about\n1College of Atmospheric Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China. 2College of Physical Sc\n\n[TRUNCATED]",

A\ncombination of historical deposition data of measured wet NHx and modeled dry NHx in China suggests that dry NHx deposition has\nbeen increasing substantially (4.50% yr−1, p < 0.05) since 1980. Here, chemical transport model (WRF-EMEP) results indicate that\nvariation in NH3 emissions is not a dominant factor resulting in the continually increasing trends of dry NHx deposition, while\nclimate change-induced trends in precipitation patterns with less frequent light rain and more frequent consecutive rain events\n(with ≥2 consecutive rainy days) contribute to the increase in dry NHx deposition. This will continue to shift NHx deposition from\nwet to dry form at a rate of 0.12 and 0.23% yr−1 (p < 0.05) for the period of 2030–2100 in China under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5\nscenarios, respectively.

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nNitrogen deposition, an important component of the global\nnitrogen cycle, has increased twofold over the past 100 years\nglobally1 and by 60% from 1980 to 2010 in China2, as a result of\nreactive nitrogen emissions associated with rapid expansion in\nagriculture and increased fossil fuel combustion3. These reactive\nnitrogen\nspecies\ninclude\nreduced\n(NHx = NH3 + NH4+)\nand\noxidized (NOy = NOx (NO + NO2) + its oxidation products) com-\npounds. Given the continual reductions in NOx emissions, NHx\ndeposition has become increasingly important, with its contribu-\ntion currently reaching 60–85% of the total nitrogen deposition in\nthe United States and Europe4–6. Enhanced NHx deposition is\nfavorable for crop production and plant growth in nitrogen-\nlimited regions7, whereas excess NHx deposition causes greater\ndamage\nto\nnitrogen-sensitive\necosystems,\nincluding\nglobal\nbiodiversity\nloss\nand\neutrophication,\ncompared\nwith\nNOy\ndeposition8.\nThe removal of NHx from the atmosphere can occur by dry or\nwet\nprocesses1,9,10.\nWet\ndeposition\noccurs\nmainly\nthrough\nscavenging by rainfall, sleet, fog, snow, and hail2,11, while dry\ndeposition occurs by vertical turbulent transfer to the earth’s\nsurface8,9. Dry NHx deposition (often dominated by gaseous NH3)\nis a continuous process that drives plant species composition\nchange and reduces species cover and diversity much faster, and\ninflicts greater threats to plant growth compared to the same unit\nof wet NHx deposition12,13. Previous studies have characterized the\nspatiotemporal variation and ecological effects of NHx deposition;\nhowever, the main focus of these studies has been on wet NHx\ndeposition because it is relatively easy to measure in existing\nnetworks2,11, whereas long-term and large-scale dry NHx deposi-\ntion has been less studied due to the technical difficulty in directly\nmeasuring and monitoring dry deposition. It has been reported\nthat dry NHx deposition has been a critical component of total NHx\ndeposition in recent years14,15. Based on a combination of\nhistorical measurement-based wet NHx deposition and model-\nbased dry NHx deposition data, Yu et al.16 suggested that there\nhas been a shift in the relative contributions of wet and dry\ndeposition to total NHx deposition in China from 1980 to 2015;\nwet deposition previously dominated total NHx deposition, but\nthe modeled ratio of dry to wet NHx deposition (RNHxðdry=wetÞ)\ngradually rose from 1980 to 2015, to the point where wet and dry\ndeposition now have an approximately equal contribution to total\nNHx deposition (Fig. 1).

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nFine particulate matter (PM2.5, with an aerodynamic diameter of\n<2.5 µm) has been identified as a key component of atmospheric\npollution in China due to large amounts of precursor emissions\nand unfavorable meteorological conditions1, especially during\ncold seasons. Inhaling PM2.5 of high concentration poses a serious\nthreat to public health, leading to increased risks of cardiovascular\nand respiratory diseases2. Therefore, accurate prediction of PM2.5\nconcentrations is indispensable both for public health warnings\nand emission controls.\nThe main approaches of PM2.5 prediction can be divided in two\ncategories: i.e., numerical models and statistical models. Numerical\nmodels, such as the WRF-Chem3, CMAQ4, and GEOS-Chem5,\ndescribe\nthe\nessential\natmospheric\nphysical\nand\nchemical\nprocesses through mathematical formulas, which establish the\nexplicable relationship among atmospheric components, meteor-\nological parameters, and emissions in spatial and temporal\ndimensions. These numerical models, termed Chemistry Transport\nModels (CTMs), have been extensively used in PM2.5 prediction6,7,\nsource apportionment8–10 and mechanism analysis11–13 world-\nwide. However, large uncertainties arise from emission rates14,\nmeteorological data15, as well as the over-simplified chemical\nparameterizations16, may result in certain deviations from the\nobserved PM2.5 concentrations. To reduce model uncertainties,\ndata assimilation has been extensively utilized to provide more\nprecise\ninitial\nchemical\nconditions\nby\nincorporating\nin-situ\npollutant observations and satellite retrievals into CTMs17–21. It\nshowed beneficial effects on PM2.5 forecasts for up to 24 h while\nthe benefit from data assimilation diminished rapidly with forecast\nrange17,21. In addition, low computational efficiency is another\ndisadvantage of the CTMs, which usually take several hours for\none simulation day with fine resolution22.\nStatistical\nmethods\nessentially\nestablish\nthe\nrelationship\nbetween multiple predictors and historically observed PM2.5\nconcentrations through regression models or machine learning\n(ML) algorithms, which do not involve the complex physical and\nchemical processes and usually have less demand for computing\nresources compared to the CTMs. Initially, linear regression models\nwere applied to PM2.5 forecast and showed reasonable accuracy23.\nHowever, the linear assumption in these models sometimes might\nnot precisely capture the connection between predictors and air\npollutant concentrations. In recent years, ML algorithms have\ngained popularity in air quality forecast due to their strong power\nin effectively handling nonlinear relationship between predictors\nand targets24. For example, Ma et al.25 utilized the XGBoost\nalgorithm to predict PM2.5 concentrations in Shanghai and\nreported a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.77 and Root Mean\nSquare Error (RMSE) of about 12–18 μg m−3 for 24 h ahead\nprediction. Bi et al.26 developed a PM2.5 forecast system by\ncombing the random forest algorithm with CTM model results in\ncentral China, which had R2 of 0.76 and 0.64 for the next 2 days.\nThese ML methods show good capacities in capturing non-linear\nrelationships between features and aerosol concentrations at\nsingle sites. However, air pollutant forecasting is usually a regional\nissue related to both spatial relations and time sequences. The\ntraditional ML methods are still difficult to resolve the complex\nspatiotemporal correlations27.\n1Institute of Urban Meteorology, China Meteorological Administration, Beijing 100089, China. 2Collaborative Innovation Center of Atmospheric Environment and Equipment\nTechnology, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Environment Monitoring and Pollution Control (AEMPC), School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nanjing\nUniversity of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China. 3Beijing Weather Forecast Center, Beijing 100089, China. 4Key Laboratory of Urban Meteorology, China\nMeteorological Administration, Beijing 1\n\n[TRUNCATED]",

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nAs a major source of the number concentrations of aerosols and\ncloud condensation nuclei in the global atmosphere, new particle\nformation (NPF) exerts important influences on the global\nclimate1,2. At regional and local scales, NPF provides a substantial\naerosol surface area for heterogeneous physicochemical pro-\ncesses, plausibly contributing to haze formation and affecting\nhuman health3,4. Sulfuric acid (SA) is known as the primary\ngaseous precursor for NPF in diverse atmospheric environments5.\nWith stabilizing bases such as amines, SA nucleates and efficiently\nforms new particles6–8, which is a governing mechanism for\nnucleation in the continental boundary layer9–12. As suggested by\nlaboratory and theoretical studies, many candidate bases in the\ncomplex atmosphere may participate in SA nucleation and the\ninitial growth of stable clusters7,13,14. However, a mechanistic\nunderstanding of SA-base nucleation has mainly been established\nbased on binary acid-base systems involving a single base type.\nDimethylamine (DMA) has been found to be the governing base\nin well-controlled laboratory systems involving SA, DMA, ammo-\nnia, and water6,8, and it has been recognized as a key base for\natmospheric SA nucleation10,11,15. However, the SA-DMA nuclea-\ntion mechanism cannot fully explain the observed NPF rate. For\ninstance, at low DMA concentrations in urban Beijing, predictions\nusing the SA-DMA binary mechanism tend to underestimate the\nconcentrations of clusters containing two SA molecules11, imply-\ning significant, yet underestimated, contributions from other\nbases. Identifying these other candidate bases is important for a\ncomprehensive understanding of NPF in complex atmospheric\nenvironments.\nSeeking other candidate bases in atmospheric nucleation\nrequires advances in both measurements and theories. On one\nhand, the participation of a candidate base in atmospheric\nnucleation needs to be evidenced in atmospheric observations.\nThis requires unambiguous detection of base molecules both in\nthe gas phase and in growing clusters, which is challenging due to\nthe interferences of many other species. On the other hand, the\nknowledge of SA nucleation in several isolated binary sys-\ntems14,16,17 may not add up to the SA nucleation mechanism in\nthe real atmosphere, as the mixture of multiple candidate bases is\nexpected to stabilize SA clusters synergistically18. A mechanism\nthat includes clusters consisting of multiple bases is therefore\nfundamental to understanding the roles of bases in atmospheric\nnucleation.\nConsidering the concentration and base strength of candidate\nbases, trimethylamine (TMA) is a promising species for atmo-\nspheric nucleation. As a major component of atmospheric\namines19, TMA is often found in the emission sources of DMA.\nCompared to DMA, TMA has smaller or comparable abundances in\nmobile sources and residential solid fuel combustion sources, and\nusually higher abundances in biological sources such as animal\nhusbandry20,21. Consequently, one can expect that in various\natmospheric\nenvironments,\nthe\nTMA\nconcentration\ncan\nbe\ncomparable to or even higher than the DMA concentration.\nLaboratory experiments have shown that TMA is almost as\neffective as DMA in forming clusters containing two SA molecules7\nand new particles22. This finding is also supported by theoretical\nstudies on the formation of SA clusters containing up to two SA\nmolecules17,23. These results suggest that TMA likely contributes\nto atmospheric NPF. However, the role of TMA in atmospheric\nnucleation remains unclear and unverified, urging measurement\n1Institute for Atmospheric and Earth System Research / Physics, Faculty of Science, University of Helsinki, 00014 Helsinki, Finland. 2State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment\nSimulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Tsinghua University, 100084 Beijing, China. 3Key Laboratory of Industrial Ecology and Environmental Engineering\n(Ministry of Education), School of Environmental Science and\n\n[TRUNCATED]",

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nThe CMIP6 program is the most recent effort in coordinating the\ndesign and distribution of a large number of the state-of-the-art\nclimate model simulations of the past, present, and future\nclimates1. It serves as the basis for the sixth Assessment Report\nof the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR6)2. The\nobserved global warming trend can be generally well captured by\nthe state-of-the-art climate system models participating in CMIP63.\nAlmost two-thirds of the impacts related to atmospheric and ocean\ntemperature changes can be confidently attributed to anthropo-\ngenic forcing4. There is a linear relationship between global mean\nsurface air temperature and the equivalent-CO2 concentrations5.\nThe equivalent-CO2 is calculated by converting amounts of all the\ngreenhouse gases to the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide with\nthe same global warming potential. The contribution from\nequivalent-CO2 to historical global mean surface air temperature\nis about 70% on multi-decadal or longer timescales.\nGreenhouse gases (GHG), CO2 in particular, are considered to be\nthe major external forcing in the 20th century and will also have a\ncrucial impact in the 21st century projection. A high correlation\nbetween global mean near-surface air temperature and the CO2\nconcentrations has also been found in future projections6.\nHowever, many of the latest CMIP6 models have larger climate\nsensitivities than the previous CMIP5 generation7–9. Higher climate\nsensitivity indicates the ‘hot model’ problem in CMIP6 models10,\nand the larger climate sensitivity range suggests a wider range of\nwarming responses to CO2-forcing and larger model uncertainty in\nfuture warming projections11.\nThere have been several studies trying to narrow uncertainty\non estimates of past and future human-induced warming\nbased on detection and attribution techniques or metrics of\nclimate sensitivity12,13. There is a strong correlation between\nthe\nrecent\nglobal\nwarming\ntrend\nand\ntransient\nclimate\nresponse (TCR), and the past warming trend therefore can be\nused to constrain future warming projections in climate models\non global scales14. But most of the previous studies focus on\nthe projections on a global scale15. However, it is regional-scale\nchanges that are of vital importance for the impacts of climate\nchange. Under global warming, climate changes are more\nextreme regionally and induce more severe impacts. For\nexample, the rate of heatwaves increases since the mid-\ntwentieth century, but trend magnitudes are not globally\nuniform. Decadal trends in the frequency of heatwaves are\nbiggest over northern South America, the Middle East, and the\nMaritime Continent at 50% per decade, but range between\n10% and 30% per decade over most of the other regions16.

The SSP5–8.5 and\nSSP2–4.5 update the RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 in CMIP5 and have the\nmost participating climate models.

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nOver recent years, extreme precipitation events, extreme drought\nevents, extreme high temperature events and extreme storm\nevents have occurred frequently and have had devastating\nimpacts on human life and the ecological environment in many\nplaces1–4. For example, 38.305 million people were affected by the\nextreme high temperature event in China during the summer of\n20225. In the summer of 2021, China experienced many extreme\nrainfall\nevents,\neach\nof\nwhich\ncaused\nproperty\nlosses\nof\napproximately US$12 billion6. Furthermore, the Lancet Count-\ndown Regional Centre in Asia reported that hundreds to\nthousands of people lose their lives in extreme floods each year\nin China, and millions to tens of millions of people cannot drink\nwater because of extreme droughts7. In particular, in the context\nof global warming, compound extreme weather and climate\nevents, which are multivariate extremes at multiple temporal and\nspatial scales that can further exacerbate the risks and effects of\nindividual extreme events, have become more frequent. Com-\npound extreme events have great impacts on crops, grassland\necosystems\nand\nvegetation3,8–10.\nThus,\nclimate change\nhas\nbecome one of the most severe challenges facing humankind.\nAttaching great importance to the change in different types of\ncompound extreme events and research it is the key to preventing\nand mitigating natural disasters and ensuring economic develop-\nment and human happiness.\nSince the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special\nReport on Climate Extremes (IPCC SREX) first explicitly proposed\nthe conception of compound extreme events in 201211, the\ndefinition of compound extreme events has been continuously\nenriched and expanded3,12. For compound extreme high tem-\nperature and drought/rain events (CHTDE and CHTRE), the\nquantitative identification methods can be classified into three\ncategories12–14. One category is that the concurrent extremes of\ndifferent variables should be greater than or less than their\nspecified extreme thresholds15–17. Another category is to recog-\nnize compound events based on empirical statistical models of\nmeteorological indicators such as compound drought and the\nheat wave magnitude index8,18–20. The third category is to\nimplement the probability statistic indicator based on joint\ndistributions of multiple single-event indicators. In this category,\nthe effects of dependence and interaction between multiple\nextreme driving factors and compound extreme events are\ninvestigated14,21,22. The Standardized Compound Event Indicator\ndeveloped from the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and\nStandardized Temperature Index are good examples of this\ncategory23. However, most of these indicators are obtained based\non data at the monthly time scale, whereas the variation at the\ndaily time scale is smoothed out. In addition, the interaction\nbetween\ndifferent\ntime\nscales\nand\nphysical\nmeteorological\nelements is not well considered, and the extreme degree of\ncompound events is not well quantified at present13,24.\nIncreasing attention has been given to CHTDE in recent years.\nThe IPCC AR63 report indicates that the occurrence probability of\nCHTDE has been increasing at the global scale since the 1950s,\nand the frequency and intensity of CHTDE have increased with\nhigh confidence. Wang et al.25 investigated the spatiotemporal\nchanges in CHTDE over global land using SPI and the copula\nmethod. They demonstrated that the significant increase in the\nprobability of CHTDE depends on the increase in the negative\ncorrelation between temperature and SPI. In China, monthly\nCHTDE shows a significant increasing trend, especially in North-\neast China, where the occurrence probability of CHTDE has\nincreased by 0.05 per decade26–28. In addition, the continuous and\nstable\nhigh-pressure\nsystem\nanomaly\nis\nconducive\nto\nthe\nformation of downdrafts and low-level thermal anomalies, which\ncan effectively reduce cloud cover and increase solar radiation.

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nThe Earth’s climate trajectory is determined by a combination of\ninternally-generated fluctuations and external forcings such as\ngreenhouse gases, aerosols, land-use changes, and other factors.\nUncertainties in aerosol forcings continue to pose challenges to\nclimate hindcasts and projections1,2. To reduce the prevailing\naerosol forcing uncertainties, newer generations of climate models\nhave\nincorporated\nan\nincreasing\nnumber\nof\nobservational\nconstraints on historical aerosol emissions3–5. As part of this\neffort, global biomass burning aerosol (BBA) emissions used in the\nCoupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6)3 were\nupdated with a merged dataset of satellite observations6, fire\nproxies, and fire model output. In the merged BBA dataset, the\nincorporation of the satellite-based data has introduced an abrupt\nonset of large interannual variability over 1997–2014, with\nsubstantially weaker interannual variability before3,7,8 (Supple-\nmentary Fig. 1b). Although this approach utilizes best estimates of\nfire emissions based on available observational products, it\nimplicitly assumes that climate impacts of aerosol forcing will be\nequivalent as long as the net aerosol fluxes remain the same over\nan extended period (multiple years), regardless of the magnitude\nof interannual variability. The invocation of this assumption\nreflects the fact that very little is known about the impacts of\ninterannual variations in BBA emissions on climate.\nThe discontinuity in interannual variability of BBA forcing in\nCMIP6\nbetween\nthe\nsatellite\nobservation-based\nperiod\n(1997–2014) and the periods before and after is especially\npronounced over boreal North America and Siberia, where\ninterannual variations of fire occurrences and related aerosol\nemissions are strong (Fig. 1b). Boreal fires are largely affected by\nmean climatic conditions that are further modulated by different\nmodes of climate variability such as the El Niño-Southern\nOscillation, the Arctic Oscillation, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation,\nor the Pacific-North American Pattern9–13. Human intervention is\nalso important through changes in land use, ignition, fire control,\nand other perturbations14–16. With amplified warming in the\nnorthern high latitudes, boreal wildfires have been occurring more\nfrequently and intensely with regional dependencies17, and this\ntrend is expected to increase under sustained increases in\nanthropogenic forcings18–23. Earth system models predict that\nchanges in mean climate alter natural variability across a broad\nrange of timescales24, which would, in turn, affect the variability of\nfire occurrences. As such, it is timely to ask whether and how\nchanges in year-to-year fluctuations in boreal BBA emissions\ninfluence regional and global climate.\nRecent studies have documented a northern high latitude\nwarming response to interannually varying BBA emissions in\nmodel simulations7,25 (Supplementary Fig. 1a). These studies have\nsuggested that nonlinearities in aerosol-cloud processes can\ngenerate the mean warming response in high BBA variability\nsimulations relative to low BBA variability simulations. However,\nnonlinearities in atmospheric processes, including aerosol impacts\nand associated feedbacks, alone cannot account for the sustained\nwarming over decadal timescales (Supplementary Fig. 1c), as the\ntypical lifetime of aerosols from fire emissions is in the order of\njust a few days.\nWith such a predominantly atmospheric\nmechanism, atmospheric responses could only fluctuate on\ninterannual timescales and synchronously with the enhanced\nBBA variability. One may then expect a role of the ocean\ngenerating longer timescale responses25. Ocean heat storage\nand release could be considered a viable candidate mechanism\nfor early winter warming over the Arctic Ocean under high BBA\nvariability as the Arctic Ocean warming response maximizes in\nNovember (Supplementary Fig. 2) despite near zero BBA emissions\n1Center for Climate Physics, Institute for Basic Science, \n\n[TRUNCATED]",

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nSeasonal-to-interannual prediction skill and potential predictabil-\nity of El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) have varied over the\npast several decades1–6. Higher forecast skill appears evident\nduring periods of larger amplitude ENSO events2,7, but whether\nsuch changes in ENSO forecast skill represent inherent changes in\npotential predictability remains an active research question8–10.\nFor example, multi-decadal changes in the climate base states\nmight modulate ENSO characteristics, making its evolution less\npredictable in some decades than in others8–11. How internal and\nexternally forced processes could combine to drive such base\nstate changes is itself unclear7. Alternatively, event-to-event\nvariations in ENSO amplitude and pattern might occur by chance,\ndriven by unpredictable atmospheric weather, with related long-\nterm – but similarly unpredictable – variations in ENSO forecast\nskill12–16. Some studies have found that ENSO predictions might\nbe skillful for forecast leads of at least two years, but again with\nsubstantial event-to-event variation in skill7,17–21.\nCharacterizing decadal variations in ENSO skill requires suffi-\nciently long hindcast records, that is, retrospective forecasts\ninitialized using only those observations potentially available at\nthe forecast time. Unfortunately, most hindcast datasets gener-\nated by coupled climate models typically cover only 20–30\nyears22, due to computational cost and the need for three-\ndimensional global analyses for their initialization. Some longer\nhindcast records have more recently been developed1,20,22;\nhowever, these datasets are limited, either by restricting the\nfrequency of initialization to only a few times a year, and/or by\ncapping the forecast lead times at one year.\nHere, the model-analog approach23,24 is used to extend ENSO\nhindcasts back to the late 1800s and to investigate the long-term\nvariation of ENSO forecast skill, including its dependence upon the\nseasonal cycle. In traditional analog forecasting, observed states\nare found that are (in some sense) close matches to the current\ninitial state, and their evolution in the past is used to make a\ncurrent forecast25. This approach may not be too skillful if the\navailable library of previous climate states is limited26. However,\nclimate simulations in excess of 500 years could provide sufficient\ndata for analog forecasting23. That is, their more extensive\ndatabases can be used to generate ensembles of suitable initial\nstates. Then, how these states evolve within the model simulations\nprovides the forecast ensemble, with no additional model\nintegration needed, making the model-analog climate predictions\ncomputationally efficient. Such model-analog ensembles have\nbeen shown to yield ENSO prediction skill comparable to\ntraditional assimilation-initialized hindcasts made by the same\noperational climate models23. The model-analog technique has\nbeen successfully applied to, for example, seasonal forecasts23,24,\ndecadal predictions27, and climate projections28.\nThere are a few additional advantages of using model-analog\nensembles to make hindcasts for an extended historical period.\nFirst, both the initial conditions (i.e., model-analog states) and the\nsubsequent model-analog ensemble lie entirely within the model\nspace, which may avoid initialization shock29 commonly seen in\ninitialized forecast systems, arising primarily from an imbalance\nbetween the initial analyzed state and all model states. Moreover,\nthe selection of these model-analog states based upon only a few\nmonthly-averaged variables, such as sea surface temperature\nanomalies (SSTA) and sea surface height anomalies (SSHA),\nnevertheless appears sufficient to generate hindcasts that capture\nmonthly tropical Indo-Pacific skill found in operational model\nhindcasts.

Here, we examine the Black Saturday and Ash Wednesday fires in southeast Australia through a Lagrangian decomposition\nframework, exploring the origin of the potential temperature anomalies that formed these extreme cold fronts. We identify the\ncontributions of three processes: an initial anomaly at the origin, adiabatic transport of climatologically different air, and diabatic\nheating along the air-parcel trajectory.

In the warm sector, positive anomalies arrive with descending trajectories from the Indian Ocean. In the cold\nsector, negative anomalies are dominated by strongly descending dry intrusions forming as part of the cyclonic system.

In Southeast Australia an increase in fire weather\nfrequency has been associated with a poleward shift of the\nstorm track3,4 and an increase in frequency of cold fronts has\nbeen associated with the Australian fire season of 2019-20205.\nHistorical\nextreme\nwildfires\ncan\nprovide\ninsight\ninto\nthe\nconditions leading to the spread of such disastrous events.\nUnderstanding the precursors and contributing mechanisms can\nimprove forecast and management of these events by incorpor-\nating and identifying them in weather prediction and fire\nmanagement models and may increase forecast accuracy and\nenhance early warning systems. Furthermore, understanding the\nunderlying mechanisms will help evaluate wildfire behavior\nunder future climate scenarios.\nMany components act together during wildfire outbreaks, and\ninvolve both land and atmospheric systems and feedbacks that\nproduce the right environmental conditions. Considering atmo-\nspheric systems that govern the environmental conditions, cold\nfronts are the most prominent ones in southeast Australia. Cold\nfronts are formed within a synoptic environment of a large\ntemperature gradient, and here it is our goal to understand its\ndrivers. Atmospheric mechanisms of varying scales have been\nassociated with the spread of these wildfires, from large scale\nphenomena such as Rossby wave breaking in the upper levels\nwith a strong potential vorticity (PV) anomaly6 to smaller,\nshorter-term weather phenomena such as a sharp temperature\ngradient on the 850 hPa level7,8, or abrupt surface drying9. The\nspread of the largest fires in Southeast Australia is most\ncommonly\nassociated\nwith\nthe\npassage\nof\nextreme\ncold\nfronts6,7,10–12. Strong winds as well as changes in wind direction\nthat accompany the passage of the front lead to a rapid growth\nof an extended fire progression line. The speed of the passing\nfront at the surface is connected to the speed of the synoptic\nsystem in which it is embedded13. Such intense fronts are\ncharacterized by high temperature anomalies and extreme heat\nwaves ahead of the front11,14,15 and cold temperature anomalies\nbehind it. In this study we focus on the large scale dynamical\nprocesses leading to the conditions surrounding the formation\nof the cold front.\nA Lagrangian approach that tracks the evolution of temperature\nalong the motion of the selected air masses15–18 can be useful for\nunderstanding temperature anomalies. Because potential tem-\nperature is conserved in adiabatic processes, changes in the\npotential temperature along the trajectory allow us to isolate three\nfactors that contribute to the anomaly θ0 at the target time t1 and\nlocation x1. The anomaly is defined as the difference of potential\ntemperature (θ) from its local climatological mean (θclim), as\ndescribed in the equation:\nθ0 t1; x1\nð\nÞ ¼ θ0 t0; x0\nð\nÞ þ θ t1; x1\nð\nÞ \u0002 θ t0; x0\nð\nÞ\nð\nÞ þ θclim t0; x0\nð\nÞ \u0002 θclim t1; x1\nð\nÞ\nð\nÞ\n(1a)\nwhere the RHS of the equation represents the adiabatic advection\nof an initial anomaly that existed in the air mass origin t0; x0\nð\nÞ,\ndiabatic heating along the air mass trajectory resulting in changes\nto potential temperature of the air mass, and adiabatic transport\nof climatologically different air masses from the air mass origin,\nrespectively. In this study we revisit two large historical wildfires,\nthe Black Saturday fire of 2009 and the Ash Wednesday fire of\n1983. We implement a Lagrangian framework and analyze air\nmass trajectories in each case, to examine the origin of the\nextreme temperature drop across the cold front.

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nDrylands are generally characterized by water shortage, infertile\nsoil, and scant coverage of vegetation. Such regions include water-\nscarce environments such as deserts, croplands, grasslands, and\nshrublands that account for approximately 40% of the global land\narea1. Drylands provide food, energy, water, and ecosystem\nservices; consequently, their long-term sustainable development is\na critical issue. Furthermore, intensive human interventions and\nextreme climatic regimes accompanying global climate change\nare expected to render dryland ecosystems even more sensitive to\nthe growing dangers of extreme events such as drought and\nheatwave2,3.\nCrop and livestock productions are the principal economic\nactivities in dryland regions, sustaining over 38% of the global\nhuman population. Therefore, regional vegetation growth is\ncritically important4, and high-quality long-term spatiotemporally\nconsistent records of vegetation growth are of considerable\nrelevance for assessing such environmental ecosystems. While\nground measurements and modeling evidence indicate reduced\nvegetation productivity in arid and semi-arid regions over recent\ndecades5,6, earth observation studies have revealed a more\nnuanced situation with signs of both decrease and increase7,8. In\nparticular, despite massive swaths of deforestation globally, such\nas in the dry woodlands of Africa and Asia9, satellite observations\nhave revealed earth’s greening in recent decades as a conse-\nquence of substantial human interventions10. For example, China,\nIndia, Australia, and regions of the Sahel in North Africa have\nexhibited\na\nbroad\ntrend\nof\ngreening11,12.\nCollectively,\nthe\nvegetation dynamics of drylands reported in the literature appear\ninconsistent, reflecting the facts that areas of greening and\nbrowning are highly geographically and temporally heteroge-\nneous, and that worldwide vegetation dynamics are complicated\nby the nexus among environmental conditions, climatic elements,\nand\nhuman\nactivities.\nConsequently,\nlittle\nconsensus\nexists\ncurrently regarding the complete picture of how and to what\nextent dryland vegetation trends are altered globally in the\ncontext of continuous human interventions and climate change.\nSustainable growth of vegetation generally requires a contin-\nuous supply of water; therefore, the pressure on water resources\ndemanded by anthropogenic and ecological activities continues\nto grow. Vegetation restoration projects on the Loess Plateau, in\nChina, and in northern India have nearly reached the limit of the\nsoil water carrying capacity for vegetation13,14. The underlying\nmechanisms of the hydrological cycle in drylands are complex,\ninvolving multipath interactions, feedbacks, and sensitivities\nbetween vegetation, atmosphere, and hydrology15–17. The ques-\ntion of whether vegetation variation affects soil drying or wetness\nis a subject of active debate in relation to global drylands. Several\nstudies found that vegetation greening increases evapotranspira-\ntion (ET), resulting in excessive soil water demand and more\necological drought18,19, while others reported that vegetation has\necological\nfunctions\nof\nwater\nconservation\nand\nwater\nuse\nefficiency regulation, and that precipitation can compensate for\nsoil moisture (SM) loss due to increased ET20–22. This controversy\nrelates to the variety of assessments based on different available\ndatasets from different regions and on different spatio-temporal\nscales. Furthermore, a knowledge gap remains regarding the\nresponse and shift of terrestrial water storage (TWS) in relation to\nfuture vegetation dynamics, particularly under the background of\nglobal climate change23–25, which restricts our ability to manage\nagricultural forestry and animal husbandry.\nHerein, we examine the trends of vegetation growth and\nterrestrial water storages of earth’s drylands over the past four\ndecades, and assess the response of terrestrial water storages to\nvegetation growth.

Meanwhile, CVDs accounted\nfor 24% of all hospital admission among middle-aged people from\n21 countries, and accounted for 59% in the developing countries3.\nIn China, the prevalence of CVD is serious and continues to rise,\nand the death rate is higher in rural regions than that in urban\nregions4.\nOngoing climate change has received increasing attention,\ncharacterized by increasing surface temperature5. Previous studies\ncollected and analyzed historical data, and suggested that warmer\ntemperatures may increase the hospital admission from CVD and\nits subcategories6. Moreover, the global surface temperature is\npredicted to increase between 2.6 oC and 4.8 oC from 1986–2005\nto 2081–2100 under high-emission scenarios, which may con-\ntribute to an increased incidence of CVD in future. Thus, projecting\npotential influence of continued warming in the future is critical\nfor policymakers to develop mitigation initiatives to minimize\nfuture CVD burden.\nCurrent studies have focused on projections of CVD deaths\nrelated to future non-optimal temperature in highly developed\nurban areas7,8, resulting in considerable uncertainties when\ngeneralizing the evidence to morbidity (i.e. hospital admission)\nor to regions with diverse socioeconomic levels.

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nMonsoon is a forced response of the coupled atmosphere-land-\nocean system to annual variation of solar radiation1.

Projecting future changes in global monsoon\nrainfall is of fundamental societal and scientific importance.\nPrimary sources of the uncertainties in projecting near-term\nfuture changes of global monsoon come from the internal\nvariability and the uncertainties in the model’s representation of\nthe real world5. The projected near future change of monsoons is\ncritically affected by decadal variability. Therefore, understanding\nthe monsoon’s decadal variability and its associated physical\nprocess in a warmer climate is crucial to future climate prediction\nand adaptation.\nPrevious studies have shown that East Asian and Indian\nmonsoon precipitation experienced decadal variability in the\nhistorical period6–9. Efforts have been made to explore the causes\nof decadal variability in individual regional monsoons. Decadal\nvariation of East Asian land monsoon rainfall was primarily linked\nto cooling over the central-eastern tropical Pacific and warming\nover the extratropical North Pacific and western tropical Pacific10.\nThe interdecadal shift of the Indian summer monsoon (ISM)\naround the late twentieth century was attributed to Interdecadal\nPacific Oscillation (IPO)11. Furthermore, Atlantic Multidecadal\nOscillation (AMO) and IPO also significantly contribute to the\ndecadal variations in West Africa monsoon12. However, on the\ndecadal or longer time scale, monsoon rainfall is mainly regulated\nby planetary-scale\nfactors13. Investigating\nmonsoon decadal\nvariability from a global perspective might be more appropriate.\nThus, by analyzing long-term observation data, the decadal\nvariability\nof\nNorthern\nHemisphere\nland\nmonsoon\nrainfall\n(NHLMR), which profoundly impacts the global hydroclimate, is\nfound to be primarily driven by an east-west thermal contrast in\nthe Pacific (EWPC) and a north-south hemispheric thermal contrast\nin the Atlantic and Indian Oceans (NAID)14. Both the EWPC and\nNAID drivers are regional manifestations of IPO/AMO related SST\nanomalies, which are demonstrated to modulate monsoon\nprecipitation substantially15,16.\nHow would NHLMR vary, and why there be such changes in the\nfuture? Progress has been made in projecting the trend and mean\nstate of NHLMR in the warming climate4,17–21. The NHLMR is\nprojected to increase under Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP)\n1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 using the Coupled Model\nIntercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models22,23. The rising\ntemperature in the future will increase atmospheric moisture,\nresulting in the “wet gets wetter” pattern24 if the circulation\npattern remains little changed. However, future monsoons would\nvary considerably from region to region20,25. The northern\nhemisphere (NH) monsoon would significantly increase compared\nto its southern hemisphere (SH) counterpart due to the “NH-\nwarmer than-SH” pattern induced by greenhouse gases (GHGs)\nradiative forcing26. Furthermore, the GHGs forcing-induced “land-\nwarmer than-ocean” and the “El Niño-like” warming patterns will\namplify the differences between northern hemispheric regional\nmonsoons4,19,27. These two essential warming patterns might\nparticularly\ncontribute\nto\nthe\ndifferent\ncirculation\nchanges\nbetween the South and East Asian monsoons28.

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nEl Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the dominant mode of\ninterannual climate variability in the tropical Pacific. Its influence\nhas been identified to be worldwide1,2. Therefore, it is pivotal to\naccurately predict ENSO as early as possible due to its tremendous\nglobal impact. One major problem in ENSO predictability and\nprediction is the well-known spring predictability barrier (SPB),\nwhich is characterized by a band of maximum decline of monthly\npredictability (e.g., indicated by autocorrelation) of sea surface\ntemperature (SST; e.g., Niño3.4) anomalies in the boreal spring3–5.\nThis maximum decline of ENSO predictability occurs in spring,\nregardless of different initial months5,6. Since then, researchers\nhave begun to more focus on understanding the ENSO SPB7,8.\nIncluding upper ocean temperatures in the initial conditions can\nprovide an additional skill to cross the boreal spring7. Other\naspects like westerly wind bursts in the prediction system also\nsignificantly increase ENSO prediction skill and weaken the so-\ncalled spring prediction barrier8. Nevertheless, the SPB is still an\nobstacle for dynamical and statistical forecasting models even\nwith additional signals from the subsurface temperature in the\ntropical Pacific9,10.\nThe asymmetric characteristic in ENSO predictability remains\nunclear11.\nBased\non\nobservational\nENSO\nprecursors,\nsome\nstudies suggested that El Niño is more predictable than La\nNiña2. The similar conclusion through the ensemble forecast\nexperiments can be found in a perfect model framework12.\nAlternatively, some studies demonstrated that strong La Niña\nevents are more predictable because they are mostly driven by\nthe thermocline feedback, while strong El Niño almost are driven\nby stochastic wind forcing11,13. The western Pacific oceanic heat\ncontent is a better predictor for La Niña than El Niño14. Recently,\nsome studies suggested that El Niño and La Niña events are\nequally predictable through real-time seasonal ENSO forecasts\ninitialized by oceanic observations15. In addition, using Commu-\nnity Earth System Model in a perfect model scenario, researchers\ndemonstrated that additional observations in the equatorial\nregions may greatly improve El Niño predictions while the\nobservations in the off-equatorial regions around 10°N in the\ncentral Pacific may be necessary to improve La Niña predic-\ntions16. Although much efforts have been made to investigate\nthe predictability of El Niño and La Niña, the asymmetry of ENSO\npredictability has not been explored from the perspective of\nSPB. Particularly, we focus on the ENSO asymmetry in short-term\npredictability on springtime initial condition.\nGiven that the nonlinear terms have been identified to play a\nrole in ENSO asymmetry13, these nonlinear terms may also be a\nreason for ENSO asymmetry in SPB. ENSO nonlinear characteristic\nof the amplitude, spatial pattern and time evolution are both\nrelated to the nonlinear response of the zonal winds to SST\nanomalies13,17. In addition, the nonlinear wind response to SST\nplays a leading role in the genesis of ENSO asymmetry18. However,\nthe role of these terms is yet to be studied in the ENSO asymmetry\nof predictability.\nIn this study, we aim to find the ENSO asymmetry of\npredictability from the view of SPB and demonstrate the\npossible mechanism to cause this asymmetry. We analyze the\nSPB intensity of El Niño and La Niña years both in observation\nand 29 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 models\n(CMIP6). We then identify the key factors leading to SPB\nasymmetry in the recharge oscillator model (ROM), observations\nand CMIP6.

Numerous studies have well-studied the nitrate\nformation pathways in terrestrial and coastal areas4–8. However,\ndue to observational restrictions and other limitations, the\nformation mechanism of nitrate in the oceans, especially in the\nArctic Circle, is still unclear and needs to be further studied. Nitrate\nimpacts the oxidation capacity of the oceanic atmosphere9. In\naddition, many free radical groups (e.g., HO2, RO2, OH, etc.) are\ninvolved in the formation process of nitrate10. Nitrate is widely\nrecognized as an important factor for understanding the marine\ngeochemical cycle, especially to understand the atmospheric\noxidation related to reactive nitrogen11–13.\nDuring the rapid cycle of NOx during the day, NO2 undergoes\nphotolysis and decomposes into NO and atomic oxygen, and then\nO3 is generated after the atomic molecular oxygen combines with\nmolecular oxygen14. Tropospheric NO is mainly oxidized by O3\nand HO2/RO2:\nNO þ O3 ! NO2 þ O2\n(1)\nNO þ HO2=RO2 !

Recently, in a rare\nevent, Typhoon Bavi (2020) reached major typhoon status and became the strongest typhoon in the ECS in the past decade. Based\non in situ observations and model simulations, we discover that this typhoon is fueled by a marine heatwave, which creates a very\nwarm ocean condition with sea surface temperature (SST) exceeding 30 °C. Also, because of suppressed typhoon-induced SST\ncooling caused by the shallow water depth (41 m) and strong salinity stratification (river runoff) within the ECS, the SST beneath the\ntyphoon remains relatively high and enhances the total heat flux for the typhoon. More interestingly, due to the fair weather ahead\nof the typhoon, we find that the rapid development of this marine heatwave is likely, in part, attributed to the typhoon itself. As the\nrisks from typhoons and marine heatwaves are heightening under climate change, this study provides important insights into the\ninteraction between typhoons and marine heatwaves.",
    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nIn late August 2020, Typhoon Bavi unusually strengthened to\nCategory 3 on the Saffir-Simpson wind scale when it was traveling\nup over the East China Sea (ECS) (Fig. 1), prompting North Korea to\nlive broadcast the status of this typhoon and issue one of the first\ntyphoon warnings in its history. Geographically, the ECS is a semi-\nclosed marginal sea located in the northwest portion of the\nwestern North Pacific, where the water depth is generally <100 m.\nWith a lifetime maximum intensity of 100 knots (1 kt ≅0.51 m s−1\nor 1.85 km h−1) attained at the southwest of Jeju Island, Typhoon\nBavi was one of the two strongest typhoons ever occurred in this\nshallow water region. However, its intensity increase was the\nlargest in the ECS region, with a total increase of 25 kt (from 75 to\n100 kt) in about 1.5 days. In fact, an intense typhoon like this is\nextremely rare in the interior of the ECS, namely, at a latitude\nhigher than 30°N. According to the 30 years of typhoon best track\nrecord1 during 1991–2020, only 6.7% (32 out of 480) of the\nwestern North Pacific typhoons ended up in the ECS (Supple-\nmentary Fig. 1). Yet most of these typhoons reached their lifetime\nmaximum intensity in the open western North Pacific Ocean, with\n81.8% of them actually experiencing a decay over the ECS.\nMoreover,\ntyphoons\nthat\nachieved\ntheir\nlifetime\nmaximum\nintensity, or what we may call here the “authentic” ECS typhoons,\nmerely account for 1.3% (i.e., only six typhoons) of the total\nwestern North Pacific typhoons. This statistic truly reflects the fact\nthat in this ECS region, the atmospheric and oceanic environments\nare both detrimental to typhoon development. Strong vertical\nwind shears and sharp ocean temperature gradients are common\nin the ECS2–6. Climatologically, the bottom water temperature in\nthis shallow basin can be as cold as 12 °C, which is due to the\nspread of cold water sinking from the northern Yellow Sea in\nwinter time2,3. During summer, however, the ECS is highly\nstratified by strong solar insolation, setting warm water on top\nand rather cold water at the bottom. Given this hydrographical\ncondition, typhoons can easily generate excessive sea surface\ntemperature (SST) cooling, often up to 10 °C, in the ECS2–4,6. It is\nwell-known that typhoon-induced SST cooling is an essential\nnegative feedback in typhoon intensification. It can effectively\ndecrease\nthe\nair–sea\ntemperature\ndisequilibrium\nand\nthus\nsignificantly reduce or even reverse\nthe vital energy flux\ntransferring from the ocean to the typhoon7–21. Therefore, partially\nbecause of strong SST cooling, the majority of typhoons tend to\ndecay in the ECS2.\nRecent studies found that the shallow bathymetry near\ncontinental coasts may play an essential role that may facilitate\nthe intensification of landfalling typhoons22,23. Induced by the\ngusty winds, the vertical mixing is usually the primary mechanism\nresponsible for SST cooling beneath a typhoon7,11,13,15,16,23–29. In\ngeneral, the mixing depth (or length) of a typhoon, namely, the\nwater depth at which the typhoon forcing can reach, varies from\ntens to 100 m or so, depending on ocean stratification and\ntyphoon characteristics such as wind speed, moving rate and\nsize4,13,16,21,25–27,30–32. A deeper typhoon mixing depth will usually\nlead to stronger SST cooling since more cold water is being\nentrained upward to the sea surface. However, in shallow waters,\nregardless of how strong or slow the typhoon is or travels, the\nmaximum mixing depth will be capped by natural bathymetry. For\nthis reason, the typhoon-induced SST cooling would be signifi-\ncantly suppressed or even vanish in shallow waters, eventually\nboosting the typhoon intensity22,23. However, the magnitude of\nSST cooling in shallow waters still largely depends on the\ntemperature structure of the water column.

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nThe most dominant modulators of the global climate in the recent\nera have been the number of anthropogenically induced forcings,\ncausing climate change via global warming and the subsequent\nalterations of the planetary hydroclimate1. Understanding the\nclimate responses through models and predictions faces many\ndifficulties, primary amongst those being the spatial heterogene-\nity2. Nowhere is it more challenging than in the tropics, where past\nclimate models have consistently had issues with matching the\nobservational rainfall data3, with its active water cycles4. The\nglobal knowledge of the hydroclimate response has been geared\ntowards the warm-gets-wetter5,6 or the wet-gets-wetter7–9 schools\nof thought in the tropics including the tropical monsoon regions.\nAlthough it is expected that climate change will lead to increased\nprecipitation10–12, the ground reality has been quite different with\ncases like the Indian Summer Monsoon rainfall (ISMR) exhibiting\nan extended declining trend of mean precipitation for the period\nbetween 1950 and 200213,14. Other studies have shown that ISMR\nhas a significant multi-decadal variability with the period between\n60 and 70 years15–17 and the decreasing trend of ISMR from 1950\nis a manifestation of a decreasing phase of the multi-decadal\nvariability. More recent study18 indicating a revival of ISMR to an\nincreasing trend from 2002 supports such a hypothesis that short-\nterm trends of ISMR are related to the multi-decadal variability.\nThe Indian Summer Monsoon is a convectively coupled system,\nthe large-scale winds are a result of a response to latent heat\nsource from monsoon rainfall while the convergence of moisture\nby the same winds sustains and strengthens the rainfall. Therefore,\nlarge-scale wind indices of Indian monsoon correlate significantly\nwith the seasonal precipitation19,20. However, due to the ‘internal’\nvariability of the convectively coupled system, this relationship is\nnot very strong21,22. Therefore, the multi-decadal variability of\nISMR is expected to also manifest in similar multi-decadal\nvariability in wind indices like the monsoon Hadley index or\nlow-level westerly jet (LLJ) index, etc. Further, as the extreme\nrainfall events (EREs) are the results of convective instability on the\nbackground mean monsoon condition, the multi-decadal varia-\nbility of ISMR is expected to lead to multi-decadal variability of\nstatistics of EREs over the region. Some studies show that indeed\nthe daily EREs over Central India (CI) as well as over Northeast\nIndia (NEI) have multidecadal variability21–23. Therefore, the short-\nterm trends of the EREs are largely a part of the multi-decadal\nvariability of the EREs. It has also been suggested that the changes\nin land-use/land-cover patterns owing to urbanization and other\nhuman-induced factors, along with regional thermodynamical,\ndynamical, and convective parameters, are known to have\ncorrelational and causal relationships with the ISM rainfall24.\nForewarning of the transition of trends of EREs such as from a\ndecreeing to an increasing is of great interest for disaster\npreparedness planning but a long-range prediction remains\nchallenging due to the ‘chaotic’ nature of the climate system.\nHere, we identify such a transition from decreasing trend to an\nincreasing trend of EREs in recent history and investigate the\npotential drivers for this transition with the hope that findings will\nhelp develop a long-lead prediction of statistics of the EREs.\nThe major precipitation regimes (based on the intensity) at CIR,\ninclude Light Rainfall Events (0 < LREs ≤5 mm/day), Moderate\nRainfall Events (5 mm/day < MREs ≤100 mm/day), High Rainfall\nEvents (100 mm/day < HREs ≤150 mm/day), and Extreme Rainfall\nEvents (150 mm/day < EREs)25.

To quantify this adjustment,\nwe propose a causal approach that combines physical knowledge in the form of a causal graph with geostationary satellite\nobservations of stratocumulus clouds. This allows us to remove confounding influences from large-scale meteorology and to\ndisentangle counteracting physical processes (cloud-top entrainment enhancement and precipitation suppression due to aerosol\nperturbations) on different timescales. This results in weak LWP adjustments that are time-dependent (first positive then negative)\nand meteorological regime-dependent. More importantly, the causal approach reveals that failing to account for covariations of\ncloud droplet sizes and cloud depth, which are, respectively, a mediator and a confounder of entrainment and precipitation\ninfluences, leads to an overly negative aerosol-induced LWP response. This would result in an underestimation of the cooling\ninfluence of aerosol-cloud interactions.",
    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nAerosols are airborne particles that modify the planetary radiative\nbudget, either directly, by absorbing or scattering radiation, or\nindirectly, by acting as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) for the\nformation of cloud droplets and subsequently modifying the\nalbedo of clouds1. Between pre-industrial times and 2019,\nanthropogenic aerosol emissions caused a negative effective\nradiative forcing (ERF) of −1.1[−1.7; −0.4] W m−22, thereby\noffsetting part of the global warming induced by greenhouse\ngases. The exact magnitude of the aerosol-induced cooling is hard\nto quantify, with large uncertainties originating from the under-\nstanding of aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI). Liquid stratocumulus\nclouds particularly contribute to this uncertainty because of their\nmoderately high albedo (≈40%) and extensive coverage in\noceanic regions with high insolation3,4. In liquid clouds, ERFACI is\na combination of the instantaneous Twomey effect and rapid\nadjustments of cloud macrophysical properties, namely liquid\nwater path (LWP) and cloud fraction (CF)1. The Twomey effect\ndescribes how, at an initially constant LWP, an increase in the\ncloud droplet number concentration (Nd, used as a proxy for\naerosol concentrations) will cause a decrease in the effective cloud\ndroplet radius (reff5) but an increase in the total cloud droplet\nsurface area and therefore an increase in cloud albedo6. This initial\nchange in Nd can later trigger LWP adjustments (∂ln LWP\n∂ln Nd ), which are\nhard to constrain because they result from the superposition of\ntwo counteracting physical processes. On the one hand, a\ndecrease in reff leads to precipitation suppression and subsequent\nincreases in LWP and cloud albedo7. On the other hand, increased\ndroplet concentrations and smaller radii will lead to suppressed\ndroplet sedimentation and enhanced radiative cooling at the top\nof the cloud, thereby driving turbulence and entrainment of warm\n(and dry) air from the free troposphere into the cloud. This leads\nto evaporation of the smaller droplets, enhanced evaporative\ncooling and even stronger entrainment, resulting in decreases in\nLWP and cloud albedo8–12. Precipitation suppression and cloud-\ntop entrainment enhancement are difficult to disentangle as these\ntwo processes occur simultaneously and they both involve a\nfeedback loop between cloud microphysical properties and\ndynamical processes. This is illustrated in Fig. 1a.\nThe sign and magnitude of LWP adjustments depend on\ntemporal and spatial scales, cloud regimes and environmental\nconditions, making it hard to interpret mere correlations as causal\neffects of aerosols on clouds. The main difficulty consists in\nremoving confounding, i.e. the effect that a variable Z (e.g. an\nenvironmental factor) has on both a cause-variable X (e.g. aerosol\nproperties) and an effect-variable Y (e.g. cloud properties), thereby\ninducing a spurious correlation between X and Y. Ideally, causality\nis inferred from randomized controlled trial experiments. Unfortu-\nnately, this is rarely feasible in the field of Earth sciences. A good\nalternative are the so-called opportunistic experiments (e.g. ship\ntracks or volcano eruptions)13–15, or the use of climate models to\nsimulate the response of the climate system to a given forcing\nwhile keeping all other forcings constant (i.e. evaluating counter-\nfactual climate scenarios)16. However, opportunistic experiments\nand model simulations have drawbacks, especially when it comes\nto representativity, or to computational cost for simulations. For\nthis reason, many studies use non-opportunistic observational\ndata, and in particular, satellite observations that have represen-\ntative coverage in both time and space.\nPrevious ACI studies have tried to explicitly identify and remove\nsources of confounding in observational data, such as the\nconfounding effect of relative humidity (RH) on CF adjustments17,\nor the confounding effect of rainfall on convective cloud\ninvigoration18.

The\nAustralian cities of Sydney, Brisbane and Canberra have all been\naffected by billion-dollar hailstorm events (normalised to 2017\ndollars)4, and from 2014 to 2021, the seven most costly hailstorms\nin Australia caused a total of AUD $7.4b in insured losses3.\nAnthropogenic climate change is expected to affect hailstorms,\nyet the exact nature of the changes remains stubbornly difficult to\nquantify and therefore highly uncertain in Australia and across the\nglobe5. Australia is sparsely populated, and hail reports and radar\nobservations of hailstorms are generally restricted to more\npopulated regions1,6, frustrating efforts to quantify past and\nexpected future changes to hailstorms across the whole Australian\nlandmass. Here, we combine a hail proxy with radar observations\nto provide detailed continental estimates of recent trends in hail-\nhazard frequency in Australia.\nHail occurs under particular conditions inside of thunderstorms.\nNot any storm will do: hail forms only when there is sufficient\nsupercooled liquid water to freeze onto the outside of embryo ice\nparticles, when there is a strong enough updraught to support the\ngrowing embryos and when the storm structure allows the embryos\nto remain in the hail-growth region for sufficient time to grow larger\nthan 5 mm in diameter7. Wind shear (changes in horizontal wind\nspeed and direction with height) influences storm structure and the\ntrajectory of a growing hailstone within the storm, so it is an\nimportant influence on the size the hailstone can attain8,9. Wind\nshear is required for the formation of supercell storms, the type of\nthunderstorm most likely to produce damaging hail10. To reach the\nground as hail, hailstones must be sufficiently large to survive\nmelting as they fall through warmer air11.\nBased on these physical processes, there are, globally, three\nmain expected effects of anthropogenic climate change on\nhailstorms5. First, atmospheric instability is expected to increase\nowing to increased saturation deficit in a warmer atmosphere12,\naffecting storm initiation and leading to stronger updraughts that\ncan produce larger hailstones. Second, the melting-level height, at\nwhich the wet-bulb temperature is 0 °C, is higher in a warmer\natmosphere13. A higher melting-level height implies more melting\nof falling hailstones and allows only the larger hailstones to\nsurvive, eliminating surface hail14 or increasing the mean hailstone\nsize15. Third, overall vertical wind shear is expected to decrease10.\nA decrease in wind shear would normally be expected to reduce\nhailstorm intensity10, but the situation is complicated because\nlocal changes in wind shear may differ at times when hailstorms\noccur16,17. Combining these offsetting factors, the broad expecta-\ntion is that under climate change, surface hail may become less\nfrequent due to increased melt but more severe owing to\nincreased hailstone size at the ground5. However, observations\nand simulated projections show that this expectation does not\nhold everywhere, with strong geographical inhomogeneity in\nclimate responses and the resulting effects on hailstorms5.\nHailstorms are notoriously difficult to observe and model\nbecause they are small-scale and relatively rare phenomena5. In\nlocations\nwhere\nno\nground\nobservations\nare\navailable,\nenvironment-based hail proxies are often the best tool for\nestimating the probability of hail occurrence5,10. Such hail proxies\nuse an “ingredients-based” approach18 to take information on the\nlarge-scale atmospheric environment and, from it, estimate the\nprobability of hail reaching the surface: they commonly use some\ncombination of measures of instability and wind shear6,19,20.

Therefore, understanding the basic state of the\nSO is among the most important tasks in climate change research.\nAs sustained SO observations of are lacking10, numerical simula-\ntions based on coupled climate models are an indispensable and\nessential way to study the SO.\nHowever, the SO has persistently suffered a systematic warm\nSST bias in several generations of climate models participating in\nthe Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIP)11–13. This\nwarm bias appears as one of the most prominent biases in global\nSST modeling12, precluding correct simulations of the current\nclimate such as the location of the inter-tropical convergence\nzone14, the recent trend of the Southern Annual Mode (SAM)15,\nand the response of SO SST to SAM16. Moreover, it also lowers the\nreliability of model projections for future climate change17.\nA few previous studies have proposed possible causes of the SO\nwarm SST bias in CMIP models. For instance, ref. 12 found in a large\nset of CMIP5 models, that the models with a weaker Atlantic\nMeridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) tend to have warmer\nSST in the SO, and thus the common SO warm SST bias can be\nattributed to an overly weak AMOC strength. In contrast, ref. 18\nrevealed an extremely weak inter-model correlation between the\nAMOC strength and the SO SST among CMIP5 models. Instead,\nthey found the surface shortwave radiation is more responsible for\nthe diversified simulations of SO SST and claimed that the warm\nSST bias in the SO is primarily caused by the overestimation of\ncloud-related\nshortwave\nradiation.\nThese\ntwo\ncontradictory\nexplanations obscure a clear judgment of the true source of the\ncommon SO warm SST bias.\nThe warm SST bias anchored in the SO is still prevailing in the\nlatest sixth phase of CMIP (CMIP6) models (Fig. 1a), and the\nmagnitude of such a bias is comparable to those in the previous\ngenerations of CMIP models11,12, even though there are generally\nhigher spatial resolutions and more reasonable physical para-\nmeterizations in CMIP6 models than in their predecessors19.\nMoreover, the bias of surface downward shortwave radiation has\nbeen revealed to be largely remediated20 and the AMOC has been\nshown to be reasonably simulated21,22 in CMIP6 models. All these\nraise a natural question: are the causes suggested to be\nresponsible for the common SO warm SST bias among CMIP5\nmodels still working in CMIP6 models? If not, what are the origins\nof this persistent common warm SST bias in CMIP6 models?\nRESULTS\nSST bias in the SO\nThe CMIP6 multi-model mean (MMM) SST bias in the SO displays a\nzonally nonuniform band-like warm pattern (Fig. 1a).

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nThe rainfall of tropical cyclones (TCs) is an important component\nof global precipitation1,2. Resultant freshwater flooding is among\nthe most severe threats to human lives and socioeconomic\nlosses3–5. This highlights the necessity of improving the current\nunderstanding and prediction skills of TC rainfall. Nonetheless,\nthere are still large uncertainties in the characteristics of TC rain\nrate, which are modulated simultaneously not only by internal\nfactors such as intensity, translation speed, and asymmetry of\nTCs6–9, but also by environmental parameters such as sea surface\ntemperature (SST), humidity and atmospheric stability, etc.8,10–13.\nThere is a robust increasing trend of global precipitation under\nwarmer climates14,15. As inferred from the Clausius-Clapeyron\nrelation, the atmosphere can hold more water vapor at higher\ntemperatures, corresponding to a rate of ~7% per degree Celsius.\nAs such, most global and regional climate models have projected\nincreased TC rain rates with global warming16–20, wherein Knutson\net al.17 noted that the rain rate within 100 km of the storm center\nmay increase on the order of 20% by 2100. The availability of\nglobal satellite observations can provide clues for the robustness\nof model predictions. In combination with the Tropical Rainfall\nMeasuring Mission (TRMM) product and global atmospheric\nmodel simulations, Lin et al.13 found that although TC rain rate\nincreases with increasing absolute SST, the rainfall area is\ndominantly controlled by relative SST. Based on a 19-year time\nseries of observational data, Guzman and Jiang21 suggested a\nremarkably increasing trend of TC rain rate by ~1.3% per year,\nwhich\nis\nnonetheless\nattributed\nto\na\ncombined\neffect\nof\ndecreasing inner-core rainfall and increasing rain rate in the\nrainband region. The decreasing trend of inner-core rain rate of\nTCs is highlighted in Tu et al.22, which indicated that the TC rain\nrate decreases by ~1.2% per year within ~100–125 km from the\nstorm center. Consequently, the overall increasing trend of TC\nsystem is about 0.4% per year, being much lower than that\nreported by Guzman and Jiang21. Whatever the quantitative\ndiscrepancies in previous work, the observed decreasing trend of\nTC rainfall in the inner core contradicts the steadily increasing TC\nrainfall by model projections. There could be important physical\nprocesses that occur in the real world but are not resolved in\nclimate models, as also cautioned by Knutson et al.17.\nTCs are strongly rotating systems with intense inertial stability in\nthe inner core that protects the TCs from possible environmental\ninfluences23,24. Since the decreasing trend of TC rain rate is most\nsignificant near the storm center, diminishing radially outward\nmonotonically (Fig. 1a, b), the dominant contributor should be\ncapable of affecting TC inner core directly, such as the sea surface\ncooling (SSC) underlying a translating TC. Under global warming,\nthe sea surface warms at a greater rate than the subsurface water,\ncausing a strengthening of upper-ocean stratification25. This\ncontributes to a significant increase in global TC-induced SSC26.\nThe enhanced cold wakes by TCs have offset a small part of TC\nintensity increase under global warming conditions27,28, while\ntheir effect on TC precipitation remains unclear. The contribution\nof SSC to TC rainfall will be examined in this study, with a\ncomparison to the background rainfall. For each TC location, a\nsquare domain with widths of 20° centered around the TC center\nis used to derive TC rainfall; the background rainfall is derived\nusing the same domain, but with the precipitation data shifted\nfrom one year before. Therefore, the background rainfall covers a\ntime period one year shorter than TC rainfall (see section 4 for\nmore details). We will demonstrate in this study that there is a net\ndecreasing rainfall trend of TCs relative to their background\nenvironment and that it is the strengthened SSC that leads to the\nrelative decrease of T\n\n[TRUNCATED]",

Climate change has contributed to this ongoing\ndecadal drought via warming that has increased evaporative demand and reduced snowpack and streamflows.

Here, using simulations with an atmosphere model forced by\nimposed sea surface temperatures, we show that the 21st century shift to cooler tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures forced a\ndecline in cool season precipitation that in turn drove a decline in spring to summer soil moisture in the southwest. We then project\nthe near-term future out to 2040, accounting for plausible and realistic natural decadal variability of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans\nand radiatively-forced change. The future evolution of decadal variability in the Pacific and Atlantic will strongly influence how wet\nor dry the southwest is in coming decades as a result of the influence on cool season precipitation. The worst-case scenario involves\na continued cold state of the tropical Pacific and the development of a warm state of the Atlantic while the best case scenario\nwould be a transition to a warm state of the tropical Pacific and the development of a cold state of the Atlantic. Radiatively-forced\ncool season precipitation reduction is strongest if future forced SST change continues the observed pattern of no warming in the\nequatorial Pacific cold tongue.

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nDrought is no stranger to the southwest of the United States. The\nregion has undergone dramatic fluctuations in aridity during the\ninstrumental period and over the last millennium1–4. However, the\nregional population grew more rapidly than the US as a whole for\nevery decade of the post World War II era (see https://\n\nsouthwest-continues.html). Rapid growth in the last two decades\nof the 20th century was coincident with one of the wettest periods\nof the last millennium4. The current drought, which began around\n1998/995,6 is occurring in the presence of a large and growing\npopulation, an agriculture system that is a critical part of the US\nand global food supply and uses most of the region’s surface\nwater, and, due to rising greenhouse gases, a climate warmer than\nany in the history of water resource development. Warming\nincreases atmospheric evaporative demand and can potentially\nreduce soil moisture and streamflows7–9. It can also dry vegetation\nand help explain the stark increases in burned forest areas in the\nWest10. The confluence of an extended period of reduced\nprecipitation and warming temperatures, rising population, and\nintensive agricultural water use are producing unprecedented\nstress on western agriculture and water resources (ref.\n11,12,\n despite suc-\ncessful efforts to reduce water consumption. The expansion of\nforest fires only adds to the sense of a climate, resources and\nhabitability crisis.\nThe obvious questions from both climatological and social\nimpacts perspectives are: What is causing the drought? Is it natural\nvariability, forced change or some mix? When will it end and what\nwill the future be like? In terms of human-induced change,\nwarming will continue and climate models project a reduction in\nwinter precipitation in Mexico and the far southwestern US and a\nrobust drying across the West coast in spring13–15 driven by\nenhanced dry zonal moisture advection16. However, in terms of\nnatural variability, the wet period in the last two decades of the\n20th century occurred in association with the warm tropical Pacific\nphase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO)17–19, and the\nfollowing 21st century megadrought has been related to the cool\nphase that began following the 1997/98 El Niño (e.g.6,20–23) thus\nillustrating the connection between the cool phase of the PDO\nand southwestern megadrought24. The Atlantic Multidecadal\nOscillation (AMO), which has been in a warm phase since the\nmid-1990s, can also drive drought variability over western North\nAmerica25–28.

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nPakistan has experienced frequent extreme monsoon events in\nrecent decades. At the turn of the century, Pakistan was exposed\nto one of the most severe droughts in its history1,2, while the\nfloods of 2010 and 2022 were among the most devastating in\nmodern times3,4. Considering West South Asia (WSA; 65°–75E° and\n24°–37N°), the number of months with standardized precipitation\nanomalies exceeding ±1 has increased by a factor of ~1.4 between\n1979–2000\nand\n2001–2022,\nwhile\nthe\nnumber\nof\nmonths\nexceeding ±1.5 has increased by a factor of 3.5 (Fig. 1). The large\nvariations in the summer monsoon over WSA make a compelling\ncase for climate change. However, despite the apparent increase\nin monsoon extremes, floods and droughts in this region predate\nmodern climate change5,6. An attribution study also suggests the\nrole of naturally occurring processes as anthropogenic forcing\nalone cannot explain the observed intensity of precipitation\nextremes7. Therefore, it is essential to investigate these recent\nchanges in the historical context to delineate the role of natural\nclimate variability in driving such anomalies.\nAlthough\na\nsubstantially\nstronger\n(weaker)\nSouth\nAsian\nmonsoon can significantly enhance (reduce) summer precipitation\nover WSA, the remarkably wet conditions experienced in the\nnorthwestern and southern Pakistan regions in recent years are\nextraordinarily unusual. These areas lie at the boundary of the\nSouth Asian monsoon and are usually beyond the reach of the\nmost energetic weather systems capable of producing significant\nprecipitation. The dry entrainment in the lower atmosphere, the\nstrong\nwesterlies\nin\nthe\nupper\natmosphere\nover\nWSA\n(Supplementary Fig. 1), and the low heat budget in the adjacent\nArabian Sea make conditions unfavorable for rain-producing\nweather systems8. Several factors – such as atmospheric wave\nactivity triggered by distant teleconnections, circumglobal wave\npatterns, or jet stream anomalies – can overcome this unfavorable\nbackground environment and provide conditions conducive to\nabove-normal monsoons9–12. However, it is yet to be determined\nhow much of a role these factors have played in recent extremes.\nMany of Pakistan’s extreme monsoons have happened during\nyears with anomalous sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the\nequatorial Pacific in connection with the phenomenon known as\nthe El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The most notable are\ndroughts in 1997, 2002, and 2004 during El Niño (positive ENSO)\nand floods in 2010, 2011, and 2022 during La Niña (negative\nENSO) (Fig. 1). Nevertheless, the monthly teleconnection of ENSO\nforcing on WSA summer precipitation is weak: not only is the\nseverity of extreme monsoon conditions in Pakistan not propor-\ntional to the strength of ENSO forcing, but in several cases, the\nnegative teleconnection even breaks downs. For instance, drought\npersisted in Pakistan even with extreme La Niña conditions during\n1998–1999; likewise, despite strong El Niño, seasonal monsoon\nprecipitation was average in 2015. This implies that other\ncontributing factors, such as co-occurrences of other modes of\nvariability, compensate for or compound the impact of ENSO.\nEvidence suggests that jet stream meandering in the Northern\nHemisphere may be one of the contributors to WSA precipitation\nvariability11–14. On average, the subtropical westerly jet lies north\nof South Asia during the monsoon season (Supplementary Fig. 1).\n1Computational Sciences and Engineering Division (CSED), Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN, USA. 2National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/Geophysical\nFluid Dynamics Laboratory, Princeton, NJ, USA. 3Earth System Physics, Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics, Trieste, Italy. 4Doerr School of Sustainability,\nStanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. 5Bredesen Center, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA. 6School of the Environment, Washington State University, Vancouver, WA,\nUSA. 7Department of Civil Engineering, Indian Ins\n\n[TRUNCATED]",

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nThe northern high latitudes are experiencing stronger warming\nthan the global average and this warming is reflected in observed\nchanges to vegetation composition, plant traits, and plant\nproductivity1,2, which could profoundly alter the magnitude and\ncomposition of plant-emitted biogenic volatile organic com-\npounds\n(BVOCs)3.\nWarming-induced\npermafrost\nthaw\ncould\nrelease previously locked nutrients, abating nutrient limitations,\nand thereby supporting enhanced plant productivity and growth\nin this region4,5. The predicted increase in atmospheric CO2\nconcentrations might, however, inhibit BVOC production, so it\nremains unclear how BVOC emissions might respond to the fast\nand combined environmental changes in the high latitudes.\nConstitutive BVOC emissions from plants are dominated by\nterpenoids6, with isoprene and monoterpene contributing to\n~70% and ~11% of global total BVOC emissions, respectively7. The\nproduction of both isoprene and terpenes is expected to increase\nwith temperature rise3. As terpenoid production is coupled with\nplant photosynthesis, factors such as the availability of water,\nnutrients, light, and atmospheric CO2 concentrations that influ-\nence plant photosynthetic rates, can indirectly impact BVOC\nproduction. Plants growing under elevated CO2 concentrations\noften show lower BVOC production (clear evidence for isoprene8,9,\nbut contrasting evidence for monoterpenes10–12). However, short-\nterm laboratory studies have shown that the CO2 inhibition of\nisoprene production decreases at higher leaf temperatures13,14\nand it is not well understood whether this pattern is sustainable in\nthe long-term. At landscape scales, BVOC emissions vary strongly\nin space, depending on the plant species composition as well as\ntheir emission profiles15. The projected increase in atmospheric\nCO2 concentrations16, together with rising temperatures, will likely\nstimulate plant productivity and thus, increase BVOC-emitting leaf\nbiomass, while simultaneously imposing varying degrees of\ninhibition on BVOC production17 and altering spatial distributions\nof high-latitude vegetation.\nPlant-emitted\nBVOCs\nparticipate\nin a\nseries\nof\nchemical\nreactions in the atmosphere. The atmospheric lifetimes of the\ndominant BVOCs range from minutes to hours18 and the reactivity\nvaries even within the same chemical group, depending on the\nstructure of the molecule and the oxidant it reacts with. Once\nemitted into the air, these BVOCs, typically with the unsaturated\nfunctional groups, are susceptible to oxidation by hydroxyl radical\n(OH), ozone (O3) and nitrate radical (NO3)19. The major oxidation\npathway of isoprene is via OH since they have similar diurnal\nvariations. This pathway produces isoprene hydroxy peroxy radical\n(ISOPOO) which can either be further oxidised to form semi and\nextremely low-volatility organic compounds (SVOCs and ELVOCs)\nto contribute to secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation20, or\nundergo H-shift isomerization to recycle OH. The oxidation of\nisoprene by O3 also produces SVOCs and ELVOCs, as well as other\norganic peroxy radicals and small molecules19,20. Similarly, the\nSOA precursors are also formed from the oxidation of mono-\nterpenes by OH and O3 but with about one order of magnitude\nlarger yields than that of isoprene20. As NO3 is photolyzed rapidly,\nthe reactions of BVOCs with NO3 mainly occur during nighttime,\nwhich produces organic nitrates, peroxy radicals, and subse-\nquently oxidised compounds21. When isoprene and monoter-\npenes coexist, isoprene can compete with monoterpenes to\nconsume OH and produce relatively more volatile products than\noxidation from monoterpenes. leading to suppressing SOA\nformation22,23.

Among them,\ncurrent climate models suggest an almost fixed or slightly\nincreased top temperature of upper-tropospheric clouds2–4, as\nexplained by the fixed anvil temperature (FAT) hypothesis5 and\nthe proportionally higher anvil temperature (PHAT) hypothesis6.\nThis prediction has been identified as highly confident in the latest\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Assessment Report\n(AR6) and has become well-accepted2.\nThe FAT hypothesis suggests that the temperature of tropical\nanvils will not change under climate warming5. The physics\nbehind this hypothesis is based on the principles of the\ntropospheric energy balance, the Clausius-Clapeyron relation,\nand mass continuity7. To elaborate, clear-sky radiative cooling,\nattributed mainly to longwave emission by water vapor, is\nbalanced\nby\nadiabatic\nheating\nthrough\nsubsidence5,7.\nThe\nClausius-Clapeyron equation relates the amount of water vapor,\nand\nhence\nthe\ntropospheric\ncooling\nwith\nheight,\nto\nthe\ntemperature7,8. Above a certain level in the troposphere, where\nthe temperature is too cold to contain optically thick amounts of\nwater vapor, the cooling, and accompanying subsidence become\ninefficient sharply (and hence weaker), leading to a strong clear-\nsky convergence at this level5,7. Due to mass continuity, the strong\nconvergence is balanced by a strong cloudy-sky divergence.\nTherefore, the anvils and cirrus clouds associated with it are\nexpected to form primarily at this isotherm level, independent of\nsurface warming5. The FAT hypothesis was later expanded to the\nwhole globe by demonstrating that the extratropical atmosphere\nis controlled by similar fundamental physics9.\nAlthough the\nFAT hypothesis\nincludes\na\nlong\nchain of\nassumptions, its general idea is supported by simulations of\ncloud-resolving models, e.g., ref. 10, and observations focusing on\ninter-annual variations (e.g., the El Niño–Southern Oscillation,\nENSO)11,12. These studies agree with the constraint of radiative\ncooling on anvils’ temperature and show its negligible response to\nsurface warming9–14. Following this understanding, the FAT\nhypothesis was refined to the PHAT hypothesis to explain the\npositive longwave cloud feedback predicted by most of the global\nclimate models (GCMs)6. The PHAT hypothesis suggests a slightly\nincreased upper-tropospheric CTT in a warmer climate by taking\ninto account the stronger static stability at higher levels of the\nupper troposphere (i.e., the stronger the static stability, the weaker\nthe subsidence required to maintain energy balance)6. However,\nthere are also simulations7 and short-term observations (months\nto years)15–18 indicating non-negligible changes in anvil tempera-\nture with respect to the changes in surface temperature.\nAdditionally, global warming has led to other substantial global\nchanges besides the surface temperature, such as humidity19.\nDirect, long-term observational evidence supporting the FAT or\nPHAT hypotheses, or disproving them, is still missing20,21.\nHere, to explore the trend in upper-tropospheric CTT, we\nperformed a detailed, almost global (60° S–60° N) analysis on 19\nyears of daily measurements (12.2002–11.2021) by the MODerate\nResolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)22,23 aboard Aqua\nsatellite24; MYD08-D3 (Collection 6.1), hereafter MYD08-D3-C6.125\n(see Data in the Methods section for details).

Similar to the demand for high-\nresolution climate model estimates, reliable and finely-resolved\nair pollution estimates are needed to accurately evaluate its\neffects on humans and ecosystems at regional and local scales,\nand to inform effective control strategies4. Air pollutant concen-\ntrations can vary sharply over short spatial distances due to\nunevenly distributed emissions sources, meteorological transport\ndynamics and complex secondary chemical processes5, particu-\nlarly in extreme air quality events6.\nDespite advances in mechanistic and statistical modeling,\npredicting fine-scale concentration gradients remains a challenge\ndue to sparsely distributed measurement data, difficulty in\ncharacterizing complex atmospheric physiochemical processes,\nand\nmodeling\nlimitations7.\nFor\nmechanism-based\nmethods\nincluding dispersion, photochemical and plume models, issues\nsuch as missing and noisy input data (e.g., insufficient or outdated\nemission inventories), ill-posed boundary conditions, and complex\naccumulative parameterizations may lead to high uncertainties for\nmany fine-scale local applications5,8. Statistics-based machine\nlearning methods solely rely on the empirical statistical associa-\ntions between air pollutant concentrations and explanatory\nfactors\nto\nmake\npredictions.\nHowever,\nthe\nformation\nand\ntransformation of air pollutants involves varying emission sources,\natmospheric transport and physiochemical reactions within the\nplanetary boundary layer, which are also affected by altitude,\nsurrounding land characteristics and local geography4,9. These\nfeatures cannot be well captured by classical statistical or machine\nlearning techniques. Furthermore, while statistical methods have\nreported improved predictive performance, they may produce\nphysically inconsistent or implausible results10 due to sampling\nbias, lack of physical constraints, and/or confounding effects\narising from spatially stratified heterogeneous processes11.

Both scenarios\nproduce more MCS precipitation and less non-MCS precipitation, thus significantly increasing the proportion of precipitation\nassociated with MCSs across the U.S.",
    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nMesoscale convective systems (MCSs) and their precipitation are\nimportant to regional hydroclimates and, thus, numerous aspects\nof society1. Concerningly, MCS precipitation may be changing2,3,\nand at a rate differing from other types of precipitation events4\n(non-MCS precipitation). This is important because the character\nMCS and non-MCS precipitation (e.g., rate, duration, areal cover-\nage, etc.) are fundamentally different5–7 and produce contrasting\nhydrological responses8 and societal impacts9,10. However, few\nstudies have examined future changes in MCS precipitation11, and\nnone have examined how MCS precipitation may change relative\nto non-MCS precipitation due to the difficulties associated with\nrunning convection-permitting regional climate models (CP-\nRCMs12,13). Although CP-RCMs are necessary for properly simulat-\ning meso-gamma processes associated with deep, moist convec-\ntion (including MCSs14), few CP-RCM climate change simulations\nwith sufficiently long study periods (e.g., ≥10 years) and domains\nencompassing the conterminous United States (CONUS) exist15–19.\nCP-RCMs are capable of decomposing\nMCS and non-MCS\nprecipitation, and examining how these two categories of\nprecipitation respond to climate change scenarios will improve\nour understanding of regional climate change in the central and\neastern CONUS1,20. Using a suite of simulations driven by a CP-\nRCM19, we examine how MCS and non-MCS precipitation may\nchange relative to one another in two potential climate change\nrealizations.\nPRECIPITATION IN A RETROSPECTIVE AND TWO END-OF-\nCENTURY SIMULATIONS\nWe assess trends in MCS, non-MCS precipitation, and total (ALL)\nprecipitation using output from a CP-RCM for a retrospective\nsimulation (HIST; 1990–2005) and two end-of-21st-century (FUTR\n4.5 and FUTR 8.5; 2085–2100) simulations. The spatial pattern of\nMCS precipitation in HIST (Fig. 1b) is similar to observations21. MCS\nprecipitation accumulation in HIST maximizes over Louisiana and\ndecreases in step with distance from the Gulf of Mexico, while\nnon-MCS precipitation maximizes over parts of the Northeast\n(Fig. 1c). For the eastern CONUS (ECONUS; Fig. 1a.i–v), the spatial\npattern of ALL precipitation is more correlated with non-MCS\nprecipitation than it is with MCS precipitation (rnon_mcs = 0.75;\nrmcs = 0.66; p < 0.05). The difference in spatial correlation between\nALL precipitation and MCS and non-MCS precipitation is smallest\nfor the Southern Plains (rnon_mcs = 0.97; rmcs = 0.99; p < 0.05) and\nlargest for the Northeast (rnon_mcs = 0.91; rmcs = 0.40; p < 0.05).\nPrevious work examining MCS and non-MCS precipitation in\nobservational datasets reported similar findings4.\nTwo regimes of ALL precipitation trends exist in both FUTR 4.5\nand FUTR 8.5 across the ECONUS, with increasingly dry years in\nthe central and southern Great Plains, and increasingly wet years\nin the Midwest, Northeast, and Mid-South (Fig. 1d, g). This pattern\nis also evident in MCS precipitation trends (Fig. 1e, h), except there\nare more grids with significant increases. Conversely, non-MCS\nprecipitation decreases in both FUTR 4.5 and FUTR 8.5 for most\nlocations in the ECONUS (Fig. 1f, i). Consequently, the ratio of MCS\nprecipitation to ALL precipitation increases significantly over most\nof the ECONUS for annual (Supplementary Fig. 1) and seasonal\nperiods (Supplementary Figs. 2, 3, 4, and 5) in FUTR 8.5, and over\nsmaller portions of the ECONUS in FUTR 4.5. The distribution of\nregional means of annual precipitation in HIST, FUTR 4.5, and FUTR\n8.5 for ALL events, MCS events, and non-MCS events further\nillustrates these trends (Fig. 2). Generally, annual totals of ALL\nprecipitation stay the same (Fig. 2a), annual MCS precipitation\nincreases (Fig. 2b), annual non-MCS precipitation decreases\n(Fig. 2c). As a result, the ratio of MCS to ALL precipitation\nsignificantly increases for all regions in FUTR 8.5, and all but the\nNorthern Plains in FUTR 4.5 (Fig. 2b).

Central-\neastern China, with accelerating climate change and population\naging, is particularly vulnerable to increasing and intensifying\nheatwaves6–8. In the mid-to-late summer of 2022, a record-\nbreaking mega-heatwave roasted broad swathes of China, among\nwhich the central-eastern region is considered the hardest-hit\n(Fig. 1).

Given that more deadly heatwaves are\nprojected in the future, quantifying the casual factors of mega-\nheatwave and further disentangling the origin of the uncertainties\nof heatwave prediction can provide impact-based decision-\nmaking support for disaster mitigation and prevention11–14. While\nseveral studies attributed the extremely hot summer in 2022 to\nextra-tropical atmospheric circulation, tropical sea surface tem-\nperature, and local soil moisture–temperature feedback, the latter\nbeing a comprehensive quantitative attribution of the multiple\ndynamical and radiative drivers on the occurrence of this mega-\nheatwave is absent15–20. In fact, this attribution gap exists in\nalmost the entire research community for climate and weather\nextremes.\nTypically, the development, maintenance, and attenuation of\nheatwaves involve both dynamical and radiative processes21–27.\nDuring the development and maintenance of a certain heatwave,\na high-pressure system that produces clear skies allows more solar\nradiation to reach the ground, inducing an anomalous surface\nwarming21,25. Upward surface heat fluxes are thus generated,\nalong with adiabatic subsidence, leading to an increase in air\ntemperature, maintaining the local high-pressure system and\nhence the heatwave21,25. Collapses of the high-pressure system\nand local land-atmosphere feedback contribute to the termination\nof heatwave21,25. In addition to these typical processes, the\nevolution of heatwave may also be modulated by the radiative\nprocesses associated with the changes in aerosols and water\nvapor, among others28,29. For example, an increased amount of\naerosols can reduce the surface temperature and hence the\nprobability\nof\nheatwave\noccurrence\nthrough\nabsorption\nor\nscattering of shortwave radiation, and vice versa24.

In light of such a\npremise, several climate attribution methods including but not\nlimited to the partial radiative perturbation method30 (PRP) and\nthe\ncoupled\natmosphere–surface\nclimate\nfeedback–response\nanalysis method31,32 (CFRAM), have been developed to quantify\nthe contributions from individual processes to radiative forcings at\nthe top of the atmosphere/surface and to air/surface temperatures\nchanges from seasonal to decadal time scales33–37.

As a result, much\nimportance has been given to regional temperature change as\nthat would affect the weather and climate of the regions2.\nAccording to previous studies, India’s surface temperature has\nsignificantly increased during the past two decades7,11,12. The\nannual minimum temperature shows a rise in most parts of India\nat 0.24 °C dec−1 from 1980 to 201013, demonstrating a significant\nexacerbation in surface temperatures14,15. A positive trend in the\ndiurnal range of temperature has been observed over India from\n1901 to 20037,16. South India shows relatively more warming17,\nwhich is contributed by the rising maximum (1 °C 100 yr−1) and\nminimum (0.3 °C 100 yr−1) surface temperatures during the period\n1901–2007. Many studies on the surface urban heat island\nintensity suggested that urbanisation can be a reason for the rise\nin temperature in Indian cities18,19. Dimri20 also reported a notable\nwarming in India and its sub-regions by using gridded data from\nthe\nIndia\nMeteorological\nDepartment\n(IMD)\nand\nreanalysis\ndata sets.\nAccording to Kothawale and Kumar7, the average annual\nmaximum temperature has increased by around 0.07 °C dec−1\nfrom 1901 to 2003, whereas the minimum temperature showed\nno change. Srivastava et al.21 examined decadal changes in\nsurface temperature of India, and found widespread cooling and\nwarming in the southern and northern India, respectively.\nAlthough the trends in mean temperature over India were\nidentical to hemispheric and global trends, Rupa Kumar et al.22\nnoted that the diurnal asymmetry of surface temperature across\nIndia varied significantly from that recorded elsewhere in the\nworld. Krishnan and Ramanathan23 assert that surface tempera-\nture from January to May decreased up to 0.3 °C in India during\nthe period 1968–1997, after excluding the impact of GHGs and\nnatural variability from the data. According to Kothawale and\nRupa Kumar7, India’s annual minimum and maximum tempera-\ntures have also increased significantly in 1971–2003. As analysed\nby Kothawale et al.8, the all-India mean, maximum and minimum\ntemperatures have increased by 0.51, 0.71 and 0.27 °C per 100\nyear, respectively, from 1901 to 2007, with an accelerated\nwarming during the period of 1971–2007.\nCausal discovery has emerged as a prevalent approach in recent\nstudies to understand the teleconnections among different\nclimate parameters. For example, Runge et al.24 revealed causal\nrelationship between geophysical drivers and land air temperature\nin specific regions like British Columbia. They found that the causal\ndiscovery well detected the teleconnection between monthly\nclimate index Niño (3.4 region) and temperature variability in\nthese regions at a significance level of 5% within a maximum lag\n1CORAL, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, Kharagpur 721302, India. 2Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Ministry of Earth Sciences, Pashan, Pun\n\n[TRUNCATED]",

As this interest grows, divergent ideas about its current and future role in\nsupporting human life are being expressed in scientific and public discourse. We use automated content analysis to identify 13 key\ntopics about the mesopelagic zone from 2226 scientific abstracts and 4066 tweets. Two dominant ideas emerge: (1) the exploitation\nof fish resources and (2) the role of the mesopelagic zone as a carbon sink. We find that, in the absence of significant mesopelagic\nzone policy, science plays a de facto governing role by shaping how the ecosystem is known to the public and policymakers alike.\nThese results indicate the need and potential for new knowledge and governance arrangements that can broaden the range of\nmeanings and knowledge needed to anticipate future uses of deeply uncertain ecosystems and resources.",
    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nThe mesopelagic zone, extending between 200 m and 1000 m\ndepth in the world’s oceans, constitutes one of the largest yet\nleast understood ecosystems on the planet1,2. Scientific engage-\nment with the mesopelagic zone has a long history, from the\nChallenger expedition of 1872–18763, to the identification of the\n“deep scattering layer” with echo-sounding technology in the 20th\ncentury4. Deep-sea fishing programmes were run by South Africa\nand the former USSR in the 1970s and, more recently, by Iceland\nand Norway in the 2000s5. Scientific interest in the mesopelagic\nzone\nhas\ngrown\nrapidly\nin\nthe\n21st\ncentury6,7\n(see\nalso\nSupplementary Fig. 1), largely funded by the European Union\nand United States8,9.\nDeep-sea scientists argue that it is necessary to produce new\nknowledge in order to understand the mesopelagic zone and its\ncurrent and potential role in supporting human life through\nclimate regulation and marine food systems10. Attempts to\nquantify these dimensions of the mesopelagic zone have so far\nbeen accompanied by wide uncertainty ranges. For example,\nestimates of atmospheric carbon sequestration through the\nmesopelagic zone’s biological carbon pump range between 2–6\nbillion metric tons per year globally – at least equivalent to twice\nall car emissions worldwide5,11. Gross estimates of available fish\nresources also vary considerably from 1.8 Gt12 to 19.5 Gt13 – with\nsome scientists shaping expectations that fishing these resources\ncould double global fisheries landings6.\nScientists and the work they produce are thus central to current\nand future decision-making over the deep sea. By measuring and\ncodifying the natural world, science is responsible for rendering\nnature ‘legible’ to states and publics alike14. A legible natural\nworld is one that is measured and simplified, making it suitable for\nmanipulation, experimentation, and, ultimately, governance14. In\nmaking the natural world legible, science, often with state\nsupport, plays a role in supporting and legitimising political\ndecisions about environmental management15, contributing to\nthe transformation of the natural world into resources16. In this\nway, science explicitly interacts with state rules that can steer\nresource extraction through de jure state-led, legally binding\nforms of governance17.\nIn addition to contributing to de jure governance processes,\nscience can also exert de facto governing power. By studying\nseemingly apolitical technical questions in anticipation of future\nuses of the natural world, scientists directly shape what can be\ngoverned and how. From their authoritative position in society,\nand their exclusive role in accessing the mesopelagic zone,\nscientific\nassessments\ncan\n(inadvertently)\nshift\ngovernance\ndebates from first-order ‘what, if and whether’ questions to those\nthat normalise and institutionalise certain activities18. By rendering\nthe natural world legible, scientific work becomes a de facto\nmeans of shaping how resources are fundamentally understood\nand valued, as well as the principles that ultimately define state\nand private sector rules and action for conservation and/or\nexploitation18. Yet this de facto governing role of science is not\nsubject to the same oversight as de jure state-based forms of\nregulation. In light of the growing interest in the mesopelagic\nzone, it is therefore increasingly important to understand and\nreflect upon the role science is already playing in the governance\nof this ecosystem.\nIn order to compare the contents of the scientific and ‘public\ndebate’ about the mesopelagic zone, we collected 2226 scientific\nabstracts\nand\n4066\nsocial\nmedia\nposts\npublished\nbefore\n31–12–2020 that mention the “mesopelagic zone” or “ocean\ntwilight zone”.

Using a\nstylised bio-economic model of the global fishery, we demonstrate the importance of adaptive management regimes. We show\nhow the losses resulting from poor access regulation increase in a fishery system negatively impacted by environmental change,\nand demonstrate the proportional benefits provided by management strategies that control the levels and allocation of fishing\neffort. Indeed, under poor to nonexistent access regulation, highly adaptive actors can generate significant bio-economic losses.\nThis might lead to foregone benefits and cascading economic and ecological losses, whereas well-designed adaptive management\nregimes may enable making the most of the best, and the least of the worst, climate-induced outcomes for fisheries. These findings\nemphasize the need for integrated assessment approaches to the impacts of climate change on fisheries, that should incorporate\nnot only ecological responses but also the industry and management responses.",
    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nA growing number of ecological studies show that climate change is\nlikely to entail significant impacts on marine ecosystems globally,\nwith ensuing changes in the productivity of marine fisheries1 and in\nthe spatial distribution of fish stocks2,3. Expected changes in marine\nanimal biomasses by 2100 include declines in most oceanic areas,\nwith strong heterogeneity across regions and species3,4.\nThe discourse on the need for adaptation to climate change has\nincreasingly occupied centre stage in relation to these major changes\noccurring in the fish communities exploited by commercial fisheries.\nWhether to benefit from or to best cope with these changes,\nadaptation is commonly viewed as a positive force whereas fisheries\nare often represented as a fairly static force in these ecological\nstudies (e.g.5), with limited consideration of likely responses by\neconomic actors (although exceptions exist such as adjusting supply\nand demand models to climate change6). Implicit in the calls for\nindustry to develop adaptation strategies is the assumption that such\nadaptation would necessarily result in positive outcomes. While the\nstudy of economic adaptation in fisheries has attracted growing\ninterest7–9, numerical analyses of fisheries responses to climate-\ninduced ecosystem changes remain limited.\nHere,\nwe\nexamine\nthe\ncircumstances\nunder\nwhich\nsuch\nresponses may lead to positive or negative outcomes on both\neconomic returns and fish stock sustainability. Our main contribu-\ntion lies in showing that adaptive economic actors without\nadaptive management (i.e., the capacity to adjust regulations of\nfishing effort levels) may lead to fishery maladaptation (i.e.,\ndecreased\nlong-term\neconomic\nreturns\nand\nbiomass\nlevels\nassociated with fisheries responses).\nAs stressed by Papaioannou et al.10, fisheries can respond to\nshifting species distributions by changing fishing grounds or\ntarget species. A number of studies have been carried out at the\nglobal level to assess the implication of those responses5,11. To\nexamine the consequences of such adaptation, we built on the\nstylized model of the global fishery by the World Bank12 which\ntreated the world’s marine fisheries as one single aggregate\nfishery and estimated substantial economic losses in the year\n2012 (“the Sunken Billions”, hereafter SB model) due to poor\nfisheries management. We developed a dynamic version of the\nSB model (hereafter SB-Dyn, see Methods) which includes four\n“métiers” representing the combinations of two species fished in\ntwo fishing regions (métiers 1–4, see Supplementary Table 1). To\nrepresent the spatial and species-specific heterogeneity in\nclimate impacts, we assumed that ecosystem changes lead to\na 25% reduction in the carrying capacity in one métier only\n(métier 3)5,13. We modelled two levels of responses to this\nchange (see Supplementary Material for details of the model):\n(i)\necological drift: the spatial distribution of the affected fish\nspecies adjusts to changes in carrying capacity and biomass\ndensity across regions;\n(ii)\nfishing effort allocation: within management constraints,\nfishing activity is reallocated to métiers with highest\nanticipated economic margins.\nWe simulated the expected evolution of the fishery using the\nlevel of fishing effort of the SB model in the reference year12,\ndefining this level of effort as our status quo (see Supplementary\nFig. 1). Next, we considered two archetypal management regimes,\nwhich differed in terms of fishery access regulation and effort\nlimitation:\n–\nOpen Access: the fishery reverts to unrestricted entry/exit of\nfishing effort in all métiers, leading to a dynamic adjustment\ntowards zero profit levels14;\n–\nAdaptive management for Maximum Sustainable or Economic\nYield (MSY/MEY): optimal effort maximising yield or profit at\nsteady state is calculated, then recomputed to account for\necosystem change with a lag reflecting delays in management\nplanning and implementation.\n1Univ Brest, Ifremer, CNRS, UMR 6308, AMURE, I\n\n[TRUNCATED]",

    "content": "INTRODUCTION\nThe ocean constitutes 71% of the Earth’s surface, and nearly two-\nthirds of this are areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ, or for\nthe water column ‘the high seas’). Within ABNJ, there are different\nlegal regimes and governance structures for the non-living\nresources (e.g., minerals) and the living resources (e.g., fishes).\nThe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)\ncreated a central intergovernmental agency, the International\nSeabed Authority (ISA), that has responsibility to govern activities\nrelating to minerals and the ABNJ seafloor, as well as the resulting\npotential environmental impacts1. The same Convention provides\na legal regime for the use, conservation, and management of\nhigh-seas fishery resources2. These legal rules are generally\nimplemented via regional fisheries management organisations\n(RFMOs), created to regulate economically-important highly-\nmigratory fish stocks in ABNJ3. RFMOs themselves differ in their\nscope, approach, and mandate, with five RFMOs that address\nhighly migratory tuna stocks and tuna-like species such as marlin\nor swordfish. While some stocks are considered healthy4,5, there\nare significant gaps in coverage and ineffective management for\nothers6. These multiple designations have diffused responsibility\nfor ABNJ, creating challenges for the management of marine\nresources in the high\nseas, especially when the\nseparate\nmanagement of the living and non-living resources may result\nin conflicting strategies.\nThe Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ) is a large area (4.5 million\nkm2) located between Hawai‘i and Mexico in the eastern Pacific\nOcean7. There is high environmental heterogeneity across this\narea, demonstrated by primary productivity increasing west to\neast and north to south, dissolved oxygen concentrations\ninfluenced by the presence of a mobile oxygen minimum zone\nin the water column, and high densities of polymetallic nodules\non the seafloor8,9. These nodules have attracted commercial\ninterest in deep-sea mining, with 17 exploration contracts\ncurrently issued across the region by the ISA, covering a quarter\nof the area of the CCZ seabed (1.125 million km2) (https://\n\nThere are also commercial fish stocks of tuna in the CCZ, with\nthis region falling under the jurisdiction of two tuna RFMOs: the\nInter-American\nTropical\nTuna\nCommission\n(IATTC)\nand\nthe\nWestern and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC)10.\nThese two RFMOs oversee three of the main Pacific tuna species:\nbigeye (Thunnus obesus), skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis), and\nyellowfin (T. albacares) tuna. Together, fisheries targeting these\nspecies captured 3.5 million tonnes (IATTC 687,000 tonnes and\nWCPFC 2.9 million tonnes) in 2022, which was 66% of global tuna\ncatches reported that year5,11. Within the CCZ and surrounding\nwaters, catches for these species average 35,000 to 78,000 tonnes\nper year10. These are some of the most profitable fisheries in the\nworld; market price (i.e., dock price) fluctuates between $1,000\nUSD per tonne for skipjack tuna to over $5,000 USD for bigeye\ntuna, reaching an end value of over $10,000 USD per tonne12. In\ntotal, the economic value of these three species within these two\nRFMOs fluctuate around $5.5 billion USD per year (WCPFC $4.3\nbillion USD, IATTC $1.2 billion USD)13 (\nIf deep-sea mineral exploration projects, currently operational in\nthe CCZ, are permitted by the ISA to move to an exploitation\nphase,\nsubstantial\nenvironmental\nimpacts\nwould\nlikely\nbe\ncaused14–17.
