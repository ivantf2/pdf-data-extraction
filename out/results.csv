Climatic changes over the central Himalaya are critical for water resources in downstream regions where hundreds of millions of
people live. Warming and drying in this region have both occurred in recent decades, but the associated meteorological factors are
difficult to diagnose based on observations from unevenly distributed weather stations, reanalyses, and global climate models that
poorly reproduce the orographic diurnal cycle. Here, recent trends in the summer diurnal cycle over the central Himalaya are
investigated using a 36-year high-resolution dynamical downscaling. We illustrate contrasting trends over the diurnal cycle of
circulation and convection over the Himalaya. In the daytime, warming of the slopes has enhanced anabatic upslope winds. At
night, clearer skies have radiatively cooled the slopes, enhancing katabatic downslope winds. The enhanced upslope winds have
prevented any drying over the mountains in the daytime, while the enhanced downslope winds are associated with significant
nocturnal drying at high elevations. This amplification in the diurnal cycle is critical for projecting the future hydroclimate over the
region’s complex terrain.","INTRODUCTION
Among the most impacted regions around the world by recent
climate change is the central Himalaya. In recent decades, this
region has experienced rapidly increasing temperature1–3 and
decreasing monsoon precipitation.4 These meteorological trends
are likely major factors in the rapid retreat of glaciers in the
region.5–7 These glaciers are depended upon as reservoirs of
moisture, which provide water for agriculture, hydropower, and
household use as they melt annually. Melting of snow and ice
provides a third of annual discharge in the central Himalaya.8
More broadly, the central Himalaya is the source of some of the
world’s great rivers, including the Ganges and Brahmaputra, so
that precipitation in the region is critical to water resources in the
Indian subcontinent.
Reanalyses show an upper-tropospheric circulation trend over
Asia in recent decades with an increasing influence of westerlies at
low latitudes in recent decades (Fig. 1a), as found by Mölg et al.9
This westerly trend is linked to a cyclonic trend over West Asia and
and an anti-cyclonic trend over East Asia. The center of the anti-
cyclonic trend approximately corresponds to one of the centers of
action of the major teleconnection pattern over Eurasia in the
boreal summer known as the “Silk Road Pattern,” with the late
1990s being identified as a shifting point.10 This regional trend
represents a disturbance to the upper-tropospheric circulation
over Asia during the Indian summer monsoon since 1979.
To understand the impact of the regional trend on mesoscale
circulations in the Himalaya, a 36-year dynamical downscaling was
performed11 from 1979 to 2015 at 6.7-km grid spacing over a
region covering the Tibetan Plateau, the Himalaya, and the
Karakoram (Fig. 1—domain boundaries shown in panel a and
inner domain plotted in panels b, c). The downscaling employed
the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model,12 with
Climate Forecast System Reanalyses (CFSR13) for initial and
boundary
conditions.
The
downscaling
was
performed
to
investigate the contrasting behavior between the central Hima-
laya and Karakoram glaciers,11 where the latter are not uniformly
retreating.14–17 The downscaling shows the central Himalaya has
experienced surface warming and drying since 1979 (shown for
summer in Fig. 1b, c).
This dynamical downscaling was previously used to calculate
trends from seasonally averaged variables.11 However, the Indian
summer monsoon, during which almost all of the annual
precipitation over the central Himalaya falls,18 is associated with
a pronounced diurnal cycle over the Himalaya.19–23 Daytime
heating
of
the
slopes
generates
a
horizontal
potential-
temperature gradient, resulting in an upslope acceleration of the
winds; at night, radiative cooling of the slopes creates an
opposite-signed temperature gradient, resulting in a downslope
acceleration
of
the
winds.24
This
diurnal
cycle
maximizes
precipitation over the peaks in the daytime and in valleys at
night.19,23 To highlight this local circulation, the analysis in the
current study is restricted to a small subregion spanning 86–92°E
and 26–29°N (Fig. 1d, location shown in Fig. 1b, c), corresponding
to the glaciated areas of the central/eastern Himalaya, just during
summer months (JJA). This subregion was chosen for analysis
because of the co-location of significant drying (Fig. 1b) and
warming (Fig. 1c) trends over the Himalaya during JJA.
This study examines trends in the diurnal cycle in this subregion
in JJA. The diurnal cycles of precipitation, temperature, and winds
using this WRF configuration over the Himalaya in JJA have been
evaluated,23 as have the daily averaged trends (1979–2014)
identified by the downscaling.11 In both studies, the level of
agreement with observations was sufficient to justify an analysis
of the trends in the diurnal cycle using the same downscaling.
Here, we hypothesize that the warming and drying over the
central Himalaya demonstrated by the downscaling (Fig. 1b, c

Convective self-aggregation is a modelling paradigm for convective rain cell organisation over a constant-temperature tropical sea
surface. This set-up can give rise to cloud clusters developing over timescales of weeks. In reality, sea-surface temperatures do
oscillate diurnally, affecting the atmospheric state and influencing rain rates significantly. Over land, surface temperatures vary
more strongly. Here, we carry out a suite of cloud-resolving numerical experiments, and find that qualitatively different dynamics
emerge from modest surface temperature oscillations: while the spatial distribution of rainfall is homogeneous during the first day,
already on the second day, the rain field is firmly structured. In later days, this clustering becomes stronger and alternates from day
to day. We show that these features are robust to changes in resolution, domain size and mean surface temperature, but can be
removed by a reduction of the amplitude of diurnal surface temperature oscillation, suggesting a transition from a random to a
clustered state. Maximal clustering occurs at a scale of lmax  180 km, which we relate to the emergence of mesoscale convective
systems. At lmax, rainfall is strongly enhanced and far exceeds the rainfall expected at random. Simple conceptual modelling helps
interpret the transition to clustering, which is driven by the formation of mesoscale convective systems, and brings about day-to-
day moisture oscillations. Our results may help clarify how continental extremes build up, and how cloud clustering over the
tropical ocean could emerge as an instance of spontaneous symmetry breaking at timescales much faster than in conventional
radiative–convective equilibrium self-aggregation.","INTRODUCTION
Due to their relatively low resolution, current general circulation
models
cannot
simulate
mesoscale
convective
organisation
explicitly1. Yet, the recent observed positive trend in regional
tropical rainfall was stated to predominantly stem from changes in
the frequency of organised deep convection2. Similarly, in mid-
latitudes, the majority of flood-producing rain was attributed to
mesoscale convective systems (MCSs)3,4. In line with Moeng and
LeMone5, we here take MCSs to be long-lived complexes of rain
cells spanning ~100 km in diameter. Over continental regions, the
clustering of convection in an MCS poses a risk to humans as
severe storms can lead to intense downdraughts and flash
flooding3,4,6,7. Pronounced long-lived clustering can be simulated
in a process known as convective self-aggregation forming over
the timescale of weeks8–10. There, the radiative–convective
equilibrium (RCE) experimental set-up11,12 is usually employed,
assuming spatially and temporally constant surface temperature
(~300 K). In RCE self-aggregation, radiation feedbacks have
emerged as the “smoking gun” for sustaining and increasing
clustering8. Still, factors such as sea-surface temperature feed-
backs13, domain size, geometry and resolution10, as well as
periodically varying insolation14,15 or cold-pool effects16,17 were
also stated to influence RCE self-aggregation.
Prescribing constant boundary conditions is an elegant model
simplification, but it is not always realistic. Diurnal sea-surface
temperature amplitudes can be as large as two18,19 to five20
Kelvin, especially under weak surface wind conditions and strong
insolation.
Diurnal
surface
temperature
amplitudes
of
this
magnitude change the properties of the atmosphere20, resulting
in diurnally varying precipitation intensity and affecting large-
scale phenomena, such as the Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO) or
the El Niño phenomenon. Satellite observations show a diurnal
cycle
in
cloud
height
for
the
MJO21,22.
Diurnally
varying
precipitation intensity also emerges from numerical simulations
that account for differences in insolation23. Further, in contrast to
RCE self-aggregation simulations, observed tropical cloud clusters
typically are more transient, as they often persist for less than two
days24.
Mechanistically, cold pools (CPs), that is, denser air formed by
rain evaporation under convective clouds, were long implicated in
the organisation of convection25,26, both by thermodynamic and
mechanical effects27–31, and were suggested to lead to cluster-
ing32,33. In the following, when referring to MCS, we take this to
encompass both the cluster of deep convective cells and the
associated CPs, which are often long-lived. The continental diurnal
cycle of deep convection is characterised by an afternoon or
evening peak in rainfall31,34–38. Over the ocean, this daily period
can further be modulated by bi–diurnal oscillations, a dynamics
observed by Chen and Houze for local cloudiness in MCSs and
referred to as “diurnal dancing”39.
Previous studies of convective self-organisation under diurnally
varying surface temperature either did not address the emergence
of MCSs or simulated a relatively small domain37. Current state-of-
the-art regional climate models are now capable of simulating
much larger areas (beyond 1000 km horizontally at kilometre
resolution)40–43. Encompassing features, such as terrain variation
and inhomogeneous external forcing, adds unique regional
insight but makes mechanistic analysis of self-organised clustering
more cumbersome.
Through
an
idealised
set-up,
we
analyse
the
multi-day
organisation in the convective rain field over land and sea. In
our set-up, surface heating is spatially homogeneous but oscillates
diurnally. Our focus is on the spontaneous emergence of
clustering. We show that a transition from a homogeneous to a
strongly clustered state occurs spontaneously when the amplitude
of the diurnal surface temperature oscillation is sufficiently large

Tropical cold point tropopause temperature (CPT) anomalies determine lower stratospheric water vapor (LSWV) variations, leading
to a high correlation between variations in tropical average CPT and changes in tropical average LSWV. However, this high
correlation is only found in winter and spring. This work revisits the factors controlling LSWV variations using observations and
simulations over the past ~40 years. It is found that the first and second empirical orthogonal function (EOF) modes of tropical CPT
variations together explain the tropical average LSWV changes much better than the tropical average CPT variations. The high
correlation between the first and second EOF modes of tropical CPT variations and tropical average LSWV changes holds in all four
seasons. A further analysis shows that the first and second EOF modes of tropical CPT variations are related to canonical El
Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) activity and sea surface temperature (SST) variations in the central Pacific Ocean, respectively.
ENSO Modoki is also an important factor that affects LSWV variations by influencing the vertical velocity at the tropopause. The
quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) affects the CPT, and is the third process modulating the LSWV changes. The simulations also
support the results.","INTRODUCTION
Stratospheric water vapor (SWV) plays an important role in
regulating the global radiation budget, energy balance, strato-
spheric temperature and chemical processes, and global climate
change1–5. Increases and decreases in SWV have been found to
strengthen and offset global warming effects, respectively6,7.
Therefore, understanding the variations and controlling factors of
SWV is important for the prediction of global climate change.
The main source of water vapor in the middle and upper
stratosphere is methane oxidation in the stratosphere8,9, but in the
lower and middle stratosphere the main source is the transport of
air through upwelling from the tropical tropopause layer (TTL) into
the stratosphere10,11. The influence of SWV variations on climate
change is mainly caused by the variations in the lower and middle
stratosphere6. Brewer12 first showed the large-scale transport of
tropospheric air into the stratosphere in the tropics and its
dehydration by cold temperatures near the tropical tropopause.
Therefore, vertical transport is a factor affecting the variations of
water vapor in the lower stratosphere. Tropical lower SWV (LSWV)
changes have been an active research topic in recent years. Many
studies have investigated LSWV variations and their link with
global climate change13–16.
It is well known that tropical tropopause temperature is the
main factor controlling tropical SWV through dehydration12,17–26,
as determined by dynamical, radiative, and chemical processes in
the TTL27–29. The TTL is not just a geometric surface, but is rather a
thin layer with spatial structure, and various physical processes in
TTL affect water vapor transport through this channel into the
stratosphere11,30,31. Weakening (strengthening) of the strato-
spheric
Brewer–Dobson
(BD)
circulation
(e.g.,
Birner
and
Bönisch32) driven by extratropical stratospheric waves increases
(decreases) the tropopause temperature4,5,33–35. In addition, the
temperature of the TTL is also driven by equatorial planetary
waves including both tropical Rossby and Kelvin waves. Several
studies have demonstrated that penetrating deep convection
systems can contribute to LSWV28,36–38. Tropical deep convection
cools the upper part of the TTL through wave-induced upward
motion near the tropopause23,39,40.
As El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) can influence the
tropical upwelling and tropopause temperature41,42, it is one of
the most important processes controlling LSWV changes on
interannual time scales. The enhanced tropical upwelling warms
the upper troposphere and cools the lower stratosphere in the
tropics during El Niño phases43–46, influencing large-scale tropical
water vapor concentrations18,20,47–50. The vertical propagation of
ultralong Rossby waves is intensified during El Niño activity in the
Northern Hemisphere (NH) during NH winter. Observational
datasets show anomalous increased wave dissipation in the
stratosphere in the NH middle and high latitudes, warming the
Arctic stratosphere and cooling the equatorial stratosphere44,51–55.
This is also supported by simulations43,50,56–61. La Niña activity has
the opposite effect on the middle-latitude and polar strato-
sphere44,61–65.
In recent decades, a change in the ENSO anomaly pattern,
referred to as the Central Pacific (CP) ENSO (or ENSO Modoki),
which is distinct from the familiar Eastern Pacific (EP) ENSO
(canonical ENSO), has gradually become apparent66,67. The
gradient pattern of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies
(SSTA) of El Niño Modoki leads to a different pattern of
propagation and dissipation of ultralong Rossby waves in the
middle-latitude stratosphere that can affect the stratosphere,
unlike the case for the canonical El Niño. Thus, the climatic effects
of ENSO Modoki on stratospheric circulation are different from
those of the canonical ENSO50,63,68–75. The variations in convection
and circulation patterns resulting from SSTAs have been shown to
significantly influence tropopause

Rapid adjustments occur after initial perturbation of an external climate driver (e.g., CO2) and involve changes in, e.g. atmospheric
temperature, water vapour and clouds, independent of sea surface temperature changes. Knowledge of such adjustments is
necessary to estimate effective radiative forcing (ERF), a useful indicator of surface temperature change, and to understand global
precipitation changes due to different drivers. Yet, rapid adjustments have not previously been analysed in any detail for certain
compounds, including halocarbons and N2O. Here we use several global climate models combined with radiative kernel
calculations to show that individual rapid adjustment terms due to CFC-11, CFC-12 and N2O are substantial, but that the resulting
flux changes approximately cancel at the top-of-atmosphere due to compensating effects. Our results further indicate that radiative
forcing (which includes stratospheric temperature adjustment) is a reasonable approximation for ERF. These CFCs lead to a larger
increase in precipitation per kelvin surface temperature change (2.2 ± 0.3% K−1) compared to other well-mixed greenhouse gases
(1.4 ± 0.3% K−1 for CO2). This is largely due to rapid upper tropospheric warming and cloud adjustments, which lead to enhanced
atmospheric radiative cooling (and hence a precipitation increase) and partly compensate increased atmospheric radiative heating
(i.e. which is associated with a precipitation decrease) from the instantaneous perturbation.
npj Climate and Atmospheric Science (2020) 3:43 ; 
Ozone-depleting halocarbons and nitrous oxide (N2O) are well-
mixed greenhouse gases that have contributed substantially to
radiative forcing (RF) since pre-industrial time, by 0.33 ± 0.03 W
m−2 (0.18 ± 0.17 W m−2 when including stratospheric ozone
depletion) and 0.17 ± 0.03 W m−2, respectively1. A substantial
contribution to global warming and Arctic sea-ice loss in the
latter half of the 20th century was recently attributed to ozone-
depleting substances2,3. Atmospheric lifetimes of chlorofluorocar-
bons (CFCs), an important group of ozone-depleting halocarbons,
are typically several decades or centuries4. Their impact on climate
will therefore remain strong for many years to come despite
regulations
of
halocarbon
emissions
through
the
Montreal
Protocol signed in 1987.
Most halocarbons, such as CFC-12, have their main infrared
absorption bands at different spectral wavelengths compared to
the two main anthropogenic greenhouse gases CO2 and methane
(CH4), in the so-called atmospheric window region around
800–1200 cm−1 where the RF efficiency is strong5,6. The main
infrared absorption bands of N2O partly overlap with CH4, but an
important difference is that CH4 has more significant shortwave
(SW) absorption bands7,8. Although these factors may imply that
the climate effects of halocarbons and N2O differ from those of
CO2 and CH4, relatively little is known about the details of short
and long-term responses of halocarbons and N2O on climate.
While numerous studies exist on radiative transfer modelling of
halocarbons, only a few studies have performed global climate
model (GCM) experiments to investigate the climate effects of
halocarbons separately. Hansen et al.9,10 found that the surface
temperature response to a large forcing of CFCs and N2O had very
similar geographical patterns as the response to CO2 and CH4
forcing. The efficacies (i.e. the warming per unit RF) for CFCs were,
however, around 30% larger than for CO2, but close to unity for
CFCs and N2O when rapid adjustments were accounte

The role of new particle formation (NPF) events and their contribution to haze formation through subsequent growth in polluted
megacities is still controversial. To improve the understanding of the sources, meteorological conditions, and chemistry behind air
pollution, we performed simultaneous measurements of aerosol composition and particle number size distributions at ground level
and at 260 m in central Beijing, China, during a total of 4 months in 2015–2017. Our measurements show a pronounced decoupling
of gas-to-particle conversion between the two heights, leading to different haze processes in terms of particle size distributions and
chemical compositions. The development of haze was initiated by the growth of freshly formed particles at both heights, whereas
the more severe haze at ground level was connected directly to local primary particles and gaseous precursors leading to higher
particle growth rates. The particle growth creates a feedback loop, in which a further development of haze increases the
atmospheric stability, which in turn strengthens the persisting apparent decoupling between the two heights and increases the
severity of haze at ground level. Moreover, we complemented our field observations with model analyses, which suggest that the
growth of NPF-originated particles accounted up to ∼60% of the accumulation mode particles in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei area
during haze conditions. The results suggest that a reduction in anthropogenic gaseous precursors, suppressing particle growth, is a
critical step for alleviating haze although the number concentration of freshly formed particles (3–40 nm) via NPF does not reduce
after emission controls.","INTRODUCTION
Air pollution episodes, characterized by high aerosol particle
loading, are one of the major environmental challenges in China
as they profoundly impact the climate, visibility, and human
health1. To investigate the sources, chemical processes, and other
effects of severe haze pollution, extensive studies have been
conducted
in
China,
especially
in
Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei2–5,
Yangtze River Delta6,7, and Pearl River Delta regions8,9. However,
the formation mechanism of haze is still poorly understood owing
to the
multitude
of aerosol
sources,
their
spatio-temporal
variability, and coupling of aerosols with atmospheric boundary
layer processes10,11. Although primary particles emitted from
traffic12,
cooking13,
biomass
burning14,
and
other
sources
contribute to haze, secondary aerosols formed in the atmosphere
through gas-to-particle conversion were found to play an equal, or
even more important, role2,5,15. New particle formation (NPF)
events, a major source of aerosol particles in the global
atmosphere16–18, take place practically all over the world19,20,
including in Chinese megacities where the concentrations of pre-
existing particles acting as a sink are exceptionally high21–23. NPF
produces high number concentrations of small particles, which
can act as seeds for the accumulation of secondary particulate
mass via their growth2. However, in spite of its frequent
occurrence, the role of NPF and particle growth in haze pollution
has remained unexplained. Of particular interest in this regard is
the connection between mixing processes, NPF, and haze within
the atmospheric boundary layer.
We performed simultaneous measurements of particle number
size
distributions
and
chemical
composition
of
sub-micron
aerosols (PM1, particles with aerodynamic diameter less than
1 µm) at ground level and at 260 m height in central Beijing during
2015–2017 (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1).
Here, we explore the formation and sustained development of
haze pollution associated with the growth of NPF-originated
particles based on field observations, and then extend our
findings into the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei area using the Nested Air
Quality Prediction Modeling System with Advanced Particle
Microphysics (NAQPMS+APM model). Our observations provide
evidence on the influence of the boundary layer structure on the
formation and growth of particles of different composition and

Flash droughts cause rapid depletion in root-zone soil moisture and severely affect crop health and irrigation water demands.
However, their occurrence and impacts in the current and future climate in India remain unknown. Here we use observations and
model simulations from the large ensemble of Community Earth System Model to quantify the risk of flash droughts in India. Root-
zone soil moisture simulations conducted using Variable Infiltration Capacity model show that flash droughts predominantly occur
during the summer monsoon season (June–September) and driven by the intraseasonal variability of monsoon rainfall. Positive
temperature anomalies during the monsoon break rapidly deplete soil moisture, which is further exacerbated by the land-
atmospheric feedback. The worst flash drought in the observed (1951–2016) climate occurred in 1979, affecting more than 40% of
the country. The frequency of concurrent hot and dry extremes is projected to rise by about five-fold, causing approximately seven-
fold increase in flash droughts like 1979 by the end of the 21st century. The increased risk of flash droughts in the future is
attributed to intraseasonal variability of the summer monsoon rainfall and anthropogenic warming, which can have deleterious
implications for crop production, irrigation demands, and groundwater abstraction in India.","INTRODUCTION
A large fraction of 1.4 billion people in India depends on
agriculture for their livelihood. Agriculture contributes consider-
ably to the Indian gross domestic product (GDP)1. Weather and
climate extremes hamper food production, farm-income, and
overall
well-being
of
the
people
living
in
India2–6.
India
experiences droughts that can lead to a prolonged period of
water scarcity7,8. Droughts pose deleterious impacts on natural
resources, crop production, and environment1,8–10. Since the
summer monsoon rainfall is the primary source of surface water
availability in the large part of the country, the onset of droughts
in India is well associated with the failure of the summer
monsoon1,11. Year-to-year variability of the summer monsoon
precipitation in India is linked with the large-scale atmospheric
and oceanic forcing7,12,13. Positive sea surface temperature (SST)
anomalies over the central Pacific Ocean (El Nino) often result in
weaker summer monsoon leading to meteorological droughts in
India1,9,14. Persistent meteorological droughts translate to agricul-
tural and hydrological droughts, which cause devastating impacts
on food production and water availability in the country15–17.
Causes and consequences of droughts caused by the failure of
the summer monsoon in India are well studied1,12,18–20. However,
drivers and impacts of flash droughts21,22 in India are not
examined. Flash droughts occur due to the rapid depletion of
soil moisture caused either by precipitation deficit or increased air
temperature or both21–25. Favourable crop growing conditions can
translate to extreme dry conditions within a few days to weeks
due to flash droughts22,26. Therefore, flash droughts in the crop
growing season adversely affect agriculture and ecosystem
leading to considerable economic losses26–28. Understanding of
flash droughts in India is vital as agricultural activities heavily rely
on the summer monsoon and groundwater based irrigation9,29.
Thus, the increased frequency of flash droughts during the crop
growing season can result in increased irrigation demands.
Increased irrigation demands in a large area in short-time can
lead to increased groundwater pumping from the already
depleting aquifers in India29,30.
India is projected to witness extreme climatic conditions in the
future9,31–35. Extreme hot and dry conditions that lead to flash
droughts can occur more frequently under climate change32.
However, increased risk of flash droughts under a warming
climate is less recognized22,36,37 in comparison to conventional
droughts38–42. Given the significant rise in the warming that is
projected in the future in India31,32,43,44, the risk of flash droughts
in the future in India seems unavoidable. However, the changes in
the frequency and characteristics of flash droughts in India are not
examined. Here, we use observations and large ensemble
simulations from the Community Earth System Model (CESM-
LENS) to reconstruct root-zone soil moisture for the observed
(1951–2016) and future climate. The root-zone soil moisture was
used to examine the role of anthropogenic warming on the
projected changes in the frequency of flash droughts in India.
RESULTS
Flash droughts in the observed climate, 1951–2016
First, we identify the major flash droughts that occurred during
the observed climate (1951–2016) in India. We used the VIC model
simulated soil moisture using the observed meteorological forcing
from the India meteorological department (IMD45,46). The VIC
model estimates evapotranspiration using Penman–Monteith
method, which avoids uncertainty that can arise due to estimation
of evaporative demands based on just temperature47,48. Due to
the lack of long-term root-zone soil moisture observations, soil
moisture simulated using the land surface models has been widely
used for the drought assessment17,18,49,50. The performance of the
VIC simulated hydrologic variables was carefully evaluated against
in-situ and satellite-based observations

Anthropogenic aerosol (AA) forcing has been shown as a critical driver of climate change over Asia since the mid-20th century. Here
we show that almost all Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models fail to capture the observed dipole pattern
of aerosol optical depth (AOD) trends over Asia during 2006–2014, last decade of CMIP6 historical simulation, due to an opposite
trend over eastern China compared with observations. The incorrect AOD trend over China is attributed to problematic AA
emissions adopted by CMIP6. There are obvious differences in simulated regional aerosol radiative forcing and temperature
responses over Asia when using two different emissions inventories (one adopted by CMIP6; the other from Peking university, a
more trustworthy inventory) to driving a global aerosol-climate model separately. We further show that some widely adopted
CMIP6 pathways (after 2015) also significantly underestimate the more recent decline in AA emissions over China. These flaws may
bring about errors to the CMIP6-based regional climate attribution over Asia for the last two decades and projection for the next
few decades, previously anticipated to inform a wide range of impact analysis.","INTRODUCTION
Asia is one of the most vulnerable regions facing climate change
risks because of its large and dense population, rapid industrial
development, and severe water stress1,2. Climate change due to
anthropogenic factors, such as greenhouse gases (GHGs), aerosols,
and land use, has seriously impacted natural ecosystems (e.g.,
agriculture, biodiversity, water, and ocean) and human society in
Asia3,4. Asia also features the highest loading of anthropogenic
aerosols (AA) over the globe5. The absolute value of aerosol
radiative forcing is even larger than GHG in Asia during certain
periods6.
Many studies have shown that AA forcing is a key factor driving
historical climate change over Asia7–11. A widespread summertime
drying in South Asia during the second half of the 20th century
has been primarily attributed to increased AA7. Regional aerosol-
cloud interaction could be responsible for changes in extreme
rainfall over India and China during 1979–20059. Recent studies
also showed that AA forcing dominated the observed interdecadal
upper-tropospheric cooling over East Asia during summer10 and
weakening of the East Asian summer monsoon after the 1950s11.
Mostly, these attribution studies rely on global climate models
(GCMs), especially from the previous four phases of Coupled
Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP). Attribution works pub-
lished in the last years to quantify human impact on observed
climate trends, especially aerosol’s role, focused on the late 20th
century when AA emissions increase monotonically in Asia. The
consideration of the more recent period of the first two decades of
the 21st century is usually limited by the fact that the various
specially designed “historical” experiment setup of CMIP5 ends in
2005. The latest CMIP612 has extended the historical simulation up
to 2014, thus enabling the attribution of a more recent period.
However, robust quantification of the role of aerosols in historical
climate trends requires a correct representation of the spatio-
temporal variation of aerosols in GCMs, which can be problematic
in the early 21st century, because the fast economic growth is also
accompanied by increasingly stricter air pollution regulations in
China13 and India14.
Here we examine the simulated 2006–2014 trends in aerosol
optical depths (AODs) at 550 nm over Asia (India and China) in the
historical simulations of the 32 CMIP6 models. We explain the
model-observation discrepancy by tracking the emissions inven-
tory assumption, as in Paulot et al.15. We estimate the impact of
alternative AA emissions inventories on effective radiative forcing
(ERF) using a global aerosol-climate model. Lastly, we discuss the
implication of the apparently flawed Community Emissions Data
System (CEDS) inventory16 adopted by CMIP6 models on near-
term climate projection beyond 2015–2020.
RESULTS
Trends of AOD and AA emissions over Asia
China and India are the two largest emitters of AA in Asia. Figure 1
shows the relative changes in annual mean AODs at 550 nm over
eastern China (EC, 100°–122°E, 20°–40°N) and India (70°–90°E,

angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR), and Modern-Era Retro-
spective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-

shown separately in Supplementary Figure 1. Consistent with the
growth in previous decades, AOD in India steadily increases in the
early 21st century (Fig. 1b), with a trend of +14.7% per decade for

In recent decades, unprecedented extreme summer heat waves have occurred in Europe, and they have exhibited an increasing
trend since 1970s. Although previous studies have suggested that these recent hot European summers could have been instigated
by the underlying surface thermal conditions, the possible influence of shrinking Arctic sea ice and Eurasian snow cover on heat
waves are not well understood. Herein, we present evidence obtained via observational analyses and numerical experiments
indicating that the interdecadal increase in European heat waves is closely linked to the reductions in Arctic sea ice concentration
(ASIC) and Eurasian snow cover fraction (EASC) across mid–high latitudes via the excitation of the anomalous Eurasian wave train.
The combined effects of declined ASIC and EASC, accompanied by the drier soil and the stronger heat flux, tend to weaken the
poleward temperature gradient at mid–high latitudes and affect the midlatitude jet stream and transient eddy activities. These
dynamic and thermodynamic circulations increase the likelihood of more persistent European blocking events that favor frequent
and strengthened heat waves. Further projection analysis of simulations from 13 CMIP5 climate models suggests that Europe may
experience more hot summers as the ASIC and EASC continue to decline over the next century.","INTRODUCTION
In recent decades, especially since 2003, Europe has experienced
an exceptional number of pronounced heat wave events (HW) in
summer,1–4 and these events have had disastrous impacts on local
communities and economies.5–7 The causes of these European
heat waves are complex, and many studies have primarily
attributed them to the possible impacts of large-scale atmospheric
circulation patterns, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO),8
and the midlatitude planetary waves,9–11 as well as ocean and
land surface thermal conditions, such as the El Niño–Southern
Oscillation (ENSO),12 North Atlantic warming,13 and Eurasian soil
moisture variations.14,15 Other studies have noted that anthro-
pogenic global warming, particularly the Arctic temperature
amplification, has contributed to the increasing number of
summer heat wave events in Europe.3,16 During this process, heat
waves are often associated with anomalous circulation patterns
characterized by the weakening of the zonal mean jets, the quasi-
resonant amplification of planetary waves,9–11,17 and persistent
blocking conditions12,18 over the midlatitude Eurasia that produce
prolonged hot surface conditions. The weakening of the zonal
mean jets is generally due to the reduction of the equator-to-pole
thermal gradient associated with changing surface conditions.
Quasi-stationary midlatitude waves are most likely amplified by
the quasi-resonance between free and forced waves in wave-
guides with zonal wavenumbers of 6 ~ 8. For example, the
European heat wave in 2003 and the Russian heat wave in 2010
were associated with the strong amplification of midlatitude
quasi-stationary waves.9,10 The occurrence of a 2010 Russian heat
wave
was
associated
with
persistent
blockings
in
the
European–Western Russian region.12,18
These frequent and amplified extreme heat waves in Europe
have been accompanied by record declines in Arctic sea ice19 and
Eurasian snow cover.20 In particular, in spring and summer they
have dramatically diminished since the 1980s. Studies have
reported
the
underlying
mechanisms
as
the
shrinking
cryosphere-induced modulation of midlatitude circulation21–24
and adjustment of the surface energy and water balances.22
Limited studies have also explored the impacts of shrinking
summer cryosphere on European heat waves, including Arctic sea
ice and highlatitude snow cover25–27 and Tibetan Plateau snow
cover.23 However, whether there is robust atmospheric response
to the continuous loss of spring–summer Arctic sea ice and
Eurasian snow cover has yet to be examined. Furthermore,
whether and how the increase in European summer heat waves is
related to the combined impacts of diminishing sea ice and snow
cover remain unclear. Therefore, in the present study, we
conducted observational analyses and numerical experiments to
address these questions.

Sulfate aerosols are typically the dominant source of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) over remote oceans and their abundance is
thought to be the dominating factor in determining oceanic cloud brightness. Their activation into cloud droplets depends on
dynamics (i.e. vertical updrafts) and competition with other potential CCN sources for the condensing water. We present new
experimental results from the remote Southern Ocean illustrating that, for a given updraft, the peak supersaturation reached in
cloud, and consequently the number of droplets activated on sulfate nuclei, is strongly but inversely proportional to the
concentration of sea-salt activated despite a 10-fold lower abundance. Greater sea-spray nuclei availability mostly suppresses
sulfate aerosol activation leading to an overall decrease in cloud droplet concentrations; however, for high vertical updrafts and low
sulfate aerosol availability, increased sea-spray can augment cloud droplet concentrations. This newly identified effect where sea-
salt nuclei indirectly controls sulfate nuclei activation into cloud droplets could potentially lead to changes in the albedo of marine
boundary layer clouds by as much as 30%.","INTRODUCTION
It has long been considered that increasing the abundance of
cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) in optically thin clouds would
lead to increased reflectance at cloud top (the 1st indirect aerosol
radiative effect)1, and extended lifetime due to delays in
precipitation onset (the 2nd indirect aerosol radiative effect)2.
Both effects lead to an increase in planetary albedo, thereby partly
offsetting warming caused by an accumulation of greenhouse
gases in the atmosphere. Because of their high susceptibility, and
the high sunlight absorption of the underlying oceanic surface,
marine clouds are thought to be particularly important con-
tributors to the aerosol-cloud-radiation cooling effect—for exam-
ple, a 20–35% increase in low-level cloud amount could offset a
doubling of CO2
3–5. The potential role of marine clouds in
regulating climate led to suggestions of various feedback cycles
involving both primary (i.e. bubble-mediated sea-spray) marine
aerosol
production6
and
secondary
(gas-to-particle)
marine
aerosol production7. For primary production of sea-salt, it was
suggested that zonal wind speeds would increase with rising
global temperatures, leading to increased sea-salt fluxes to the
atmosphere6; while plankton activity was suggested to increase
with rising temperatures, leading to increased emissions of
biogenic sulfur gases from the ocean surface, increasing sulfate
aerosol formation, ultimately increasing the availability of CCN7.
In general, an increased number concentration of CCN within a
cloud-topped boundary layer leads to increased cloud droplet
number concentration (CDNC), and assuming the cloud liquid
content is unchanged, to increased cloud albedo. Exploitation of
this in geoengineering proposals involves regional-scale addition
of sea-salt particles, in the range 0.8–4 µm diameter8–10, to
mitigate global warming. However, such connections would
require a monotonic relationship between sub-cloud CCN and
CDNC which may not always be the case11,12.
Primary sea-salt and secondary sulfate aerosol can also become
enriched in organics under conditions of high biological activity13,
leading to quite complicated changes in the cloud droplet
activation properties. This is due to the diverse effects that
organics can have on water uptake, which can inhibit or augment
droplet activation at a given supersaturation depending on the
nature of the inorganic–organic chemical mixture14,15.
Approaches to quantify the less complex scenario of the relative
contribution of sulfate and sea-salt to CCN have typically
concluded that non-sea-salt sulfate (nss-SO2
4 ) dominates marine
boundary layer CCN at higher supersaturations while sea-salt
dominates at low supersaturations16–19. In this study, we aim to
not only quantify the first order effect of sea-salt addition (or
subtraction) to a sulfate-rich CCN population, but also to elucidate
any possible higher order effects such as modification of the
supersaturation which can indirectly impact on the sulfate CCN
concentration.
In doing so, we apply a relatively novel technique to a suite of
measurements and associated analysis of marine aerosol physico-
chemical and CCN characteristics in the clean Southern Ocean/
sub-Antarctic marine environment to quantify the number of sea-
salt and sulfate activated cloud droplets (as opposed to CCN
spectra). CCN measurements are central to the analysis, as the
data gathered are used to generate critical supersaturation (Sc)
versus critical dry diameter of activation (Dc) curves (or Sc–Dc
curves) of the ambient marine air. Our data analysis, centred on
the Sc–Dc curves, builds on the well-justified assumption that, in
the absence of clouds, the initial size distribution of submicron
secondary marine aerosol is monomodal prior to forming a cloud

Due to data availability long-term variations in precipitation rates are mostly studied based on daily precipitation recordings. Recent
research suggests, however, that variations in sub-daily precipitation are subject to higher dynamics compared to daily
precipitation and a more rapid intensification is likely. Here we show that both observational data with at least 58 years of sub-daily
precipitation records and a dynamical downscaling approach with low spatial resolution based on atmospheric re-analysis data
confirm these expectations with consistent results. High percentiles of precipitation are subject to multi-decadal oscillations and
increased during the last 150 years. We found an increase of 4% K−1 (daily), 12% K−1 (hourly), and 13% K−1 (10 min), which is
consistent with Clausius–Clapeyron- (CC) and super CC-scaling, respectively. These findings highlight that dynamical downscaling
can help to reliably shed light on sub-daily precipitation variations if small timescales are considered in the experiments.","INTRODUCTION
Short-term precipitation events with high intensities govern the
dynamics of numerous fast hydrological processes like flash
floods1 in urban areas and soil erosion2 in agriculture. It is
expected that precipitation events will intensify as a consequence
of climate change. Recent studies focused on unravelling the
relationship between temperature and precipitation following the
Clausius–Clapeyron (CC) equation. This equation suggests that
precipitation extremes—more specifically the saturation vapour
pressure—increase by 7% per degree of warming3,4 or even
exceed this rate at lower temporal scales (super CC-scaling)3,5–7.
Since temperature–precipitation-scaling also shows decreasing
rates above a certain temperature or dewpoint level, it is argued
that these scaling approaches are not valid under all possible
conditions and thus they are not suitable for projecting changes in
precipitation extremes8. Moreover, trend analyses involving long-
term records of precipitation extremes are mostly in agreement
with these findings as two-thirds of stations worldwide showed
increasing trends9. Other studies found more stations with
negative than positive trends in summer precipitation extremes
in Europe10.
Global circulation models (GCMs) and regional climate models
(RCMs) are capable of representing changes in precipitation
characteristics at longer time scales (e.g., seasonal)6. Their
applicability to reconstruct changes in sub-daily precipitation is
viewed uncertain due to (i) validation data at sub-daily time scales
with sufficient record length is hardly available and the (ii) errors
introduced by applications of parameterization models outside
their expected use. Parameterizations include e.g. convection
processes6,11, which need to be considered for model grid
spacings of more than ~5 km. Recent convection-resolving RCMs
with higher spatial resolution below ~5 km do not need such
convection parameterizations and thus are viewed promising for
simulating sub-daily rainfall6,11,12 even though they are still
subjected to uncertainties6,8. However, coarser scale GCM and
RCM simulations are still capable to represent relevant character-
istics of sub-daily precipitation (e.g., temperature–precipitation
scaling, high-precipitation percentiles)3,13,14. They also reproduce
temporal changes and trends on decadal scales15. For climate
projections on the global scale convection parameterizations are
still relevant since convection-permitting models are demanding
in terms of computational resources6,8.
Even though the availability of long-term records of sub-daily
precipitation is very limited, uncertainties involved in modelling
sub-daily rainfall extremes16 highlight the relevance of validating
RCMs and GCMs in terms of their ability to predict sub-daily
precipitation and its sensitivity to climate variability and more
specifically climate change. Climate variability including both
natural climate variability and anthropogenic forcing affect
changes in precipitation extremes over time17, whereby natural
climate variability can mask the anthropogenic signal caused by
greenhouse gas emissions18. While long-term records of daily
precipitation are in general more readily available1,19 and reflect
higher evidence4,9,10,20, only a few studies focus on sub-daily
precipitation11,17,21. Transferring results from analyses involving
daily precipitation to smaller temporal scales is not reliable due to
the higher relevance of super CC-scaling especially at time scales
below one day6.
In this study, we address the impediment to validate sub-daily
precipitation simulations under non-stationary conditions imposed
by climate variability and climate change through compiling long-
term records of sub-hourly precipitation to provide a comprehen-
sive dataset for model validation. We analyse a set of sub-daily
precipitation recordings in Austria, Belgium, Germany and the
Netherlands with a temporal coverage of at least 58 years and a

In this study, we show the relationship between sea-level anomalies (SLA) and upper-ocean parameters in the Equatorial Indian
Ocean (EIO). This work also focuses on the variability of SLA obtained from satellite altimeter data in different spatial and temporal
scales and its relationship with computed ocean heat content (OHC), dynamic height (DH), and thermocline depth (20 °C isotherm:
D20) during 1993–2015. SLA showed low Pearson’s correlation coefficient (CC) with upper-ocean parameters over central EIO
resembling a “Monopole” pattern. The Array for Real-time Geostrophic Oceanography (ARGO) in situ profile data in the central EIO
also confirmed this. SLA over this monopole showed low correlations with all parameters as compared with eastern and western
EIO. These findings show a clear signature of a persisting sea-level monopole in the central EIO. Oscillating SLA over western and
eastern EIO during summer and winter monsoon months is found to be responsible for locking this monopole in the central EIO.
Both SLA and OHC increased in EIO during 2006–2015 compared with 1993–2005. The month of January showed different
east–west trends at different times. This trend during 1993–2015 is neutral, but it shifted from negative during 1993–2005 to
positive during 2006–2015.","INTRODUCTION
The Equatorial Indian Ocean (EIO) is the second longest tropical
ocean belt after the tropical Pacific. EIO extending from 40°E to
100°E and 10°S to 10°N has a great geographic, social, economic,
and political importance. EIO plays an active role in global and
regional climate change through ocean–atmosphere-coupled
processes, and has a strong impact on many global and regional
weather
and
climate
patterns1,
including
the
precipitation
patterns over the surrounding land mass2. The key feature of
the EIO is the strong air–sea interactions and the strong air–sea
coupling shows spatial and temporal variations from intraseasonal
to interannual scales. The western and eastern EIO plays a key role
in the formation of the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)3,4. It is well
known that El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has a global
impact on climate5; in particular, the wind anomalies associated
with ENSO extend up to the Indian Ocean, and in turn affect the
basin-wide circulation6. Saji et al.3 comprehensively described the
IOD, and subsequent works recognized IOD and ENSO as the two
dominant modes of interannual climate variability in the Indian
Ocean. IOD coupled with ENSO determines the strength of the
Indian summer monsoon rainfall (ISMR)7–10. EIO also plays a key
role in exchanging heat by transporting warm waters from the
Pacific to the Indian Ocean through the Indonesian Through Flow,
thereby hosting the largest pool of warm waters of the global
oceans11. The impact of IOD and ENSO on the Indian Ocean
circulation, particularly in the EIO, has also received substantial
attention6.
Being an integral part of EIO, the Arabian Sea Mini Warm Pool12
in the southeastern
Arabian
Sea, and the
Madden Julian
Oscillation (MJO) in the central EIO, have pivotal implications on
the ISMR. Lower atmospheric and upper-ocean states over EIO
significantly control the exchange of heat and momentum fluxes
between the northern and southern Indian Ocean13. Equatorially
trapped
surface,
subsurface
currents,
and
counter
currents
coupled with wind-forced Rossby waves and Kelvin waves over
EIO are responsible for different physical regimes in the Indian
Ocean14. Strong Wyrtki jet over the western and eastern EIO
during pre- and post monsoon, respectively, uplifts the thermo-
cline at the west and sinks the thermocline at its eastern terminus,
thus causing changes in the water mass structure in the EIO15.
The EIO acts as a bridge between the southern and the northern
Indian Ocean (as well as the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal) in
exchanging the waters through advection, thereby changing
water properties (density and temperature) of these basins. Thus,
the EIO shows both negative and positive feedbacks through
strong coupling with the atmosphere. Both these feedbacks show
temporal and spatial variations through remote and local forcing,
and indeed affect the regional and global weather patterns16,17.
IOD and MJO are some of the ocean–atmosphere-coupled
phenomena affected by variations in these forcing and feedback
mechanisms, and thus induce significant changes in the tropical
weather patterns. North–South subsurface dipole is another mode
of variability observed in the tropical Indian Ocean, caused by
subsurface temperature change and resembling the patterns of
IOD (both phases) and El Niño co-occurrence years18. Cloud cover,
winds, radiation fluxes, precipitation, and evaporation are the
atmospheric parameters that influence the EIO19,20. Surface and
subsurface ocean currents, turbulent fluxes, and heat transfer due
to advection are the oceanic processes guiding the dynamics of
the EIO21. Both weather and climate anomalies coupled with
changes in upper- ocean dynamics and the lower atmosphere
have a strong impact on the Indian Ocean rim countries. Hence,
presently there is a strong focus on understanding the dynamics
of EIO in more detail by the weather and climate forecasting
community.
A direct measure to know the upper-ocean variability is to stu

Secondary organic aerosols (SOA) are one of the main sources of uncertainty in the current understanding of the Earth’s climate.
Agriculture contributes to primary aerosol emissions, but there is no estimate of SOA formation from gaseous precursors. Organic
waste products such as sewage sludge are applied to cropland as fertilizers. In this work, we show that sewage sludge is an
unaccounted source of nucleation precursors, such as skatole (C9H9N). Skatole emission and nucleation rates up to 1.1 × 106 cm−3
s−1 owing to ozone reactivity were measured in the laboratory. Our results show that SO2 plays a key role in the oxidation of skatole
and leads to intensive new particle formation. The products of ozone reactions with skatole and the possible ozonolysis reaction
mechanism are discussed. This nucleation mechanism might aid our understanding of the organic waste agricultural recycling
contribution to the aerosol balance in the atmosphere. Based on the measured particle emission flux, the surface area of sewage
sludge spread in France and the time before sewage sludge incorporation into the soil, a rough estimate of the annual quantity of
particles generated by this agricultural activity is in the range of one ton, which represents ~0.03% of the total PM1.0 emissions from
the agricultural and forestry sectors in France. As spreading occurs over only a few days (mid-summer), these emissions may locally
be of great concern for local and regional air quality during this period of the year.","INTRODUCTION

and impact Earth’s radiative balance both directly and indirectly
through their influence on cloud properties. Atmospheric aerosols
act as cloud condensation nuclei, thus altering cloud albedo,
structure, and lifetime. They also represent a major health and
economic
issue,
as
particulate
pollution
is
responsible
for
approximately three million premature deaths per year, which is
projected to increase to six million by 20501. Volatile organic
compounds (VOCs), emitted into the atmosphere from anthro-
pogenic and biogenic sources, are major players in atmospheric
photochemical reactions that contribute to ozone formation. VOCs
are also responsible for secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation
in the presence of photo-oxidants2.
As revealed by different model simulations and laboratory
studies, the most important source of atmospheric aerosols, in
terms of the number concentration and proportion of climate-
relevant particles, is new particle formation (NPF) and growth3.
However, the nucleation mechanism leading to NPF remains
poorly understood. Sulfuric acid has been identified as a key
compound in atmospheric NPF4; however, its concentration in the
atmosphere is too low to explain the observed nucleation rates, so
additional compounds need to be identified4. Base compounds
such as ammonia5 or amines6 have been proven to stabilize
sulfuric acid clusters, leading to nucleation rates similar to those
observed in the atmosphere. In addition, highly oxygenated
molecules (HOMs) coming from the oxidation of VOCs can also
stabilize sulfuric acid clusters7, and a recent study8 found that
HOMs are able to form particles without the participation of
sulfuric acid.
The
formation
of
these
compounds
from
ozonolysis
of
monoterpenes has been quantified9, and modeling studies have
quantified their formation in the atmosphere and their role in air
quality10,11. However, our understanding of the processes involved
in the formation and ageing of organic aerosols remains very
limited but entirely necessary to improve the robustness of the
models12.
It is now well-known that agriculture and its activities affect
local, regional, and global air quality, and global climate via not
only significant ammonia (NH3) and greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions but also VOC and aerosol emissions13. In some regions
(e.g., eastern USA, Europe, Russia, and East Asia), agricultural
emissions are estimated to be the largest relative contribution to
PM2.5
14. Agriculture also represents a major ground-level ozone
sink15. A wide variety of pollutants and GHGs, especially nitrogen-
containing compounds, are emitted to the atmosphere from
agricultural activities, including fertilizer use, farm machinery
operation and livestock manure spreading. In particular, in France,
agriculture is estimated to generate approximately one-third of
the annual particle emissions (e.g., from livestock housing and
tilling activities), but this estimate remains highly uncertain16.
While great efforts have been made to estimate GHG and NH3
emissions from agriculture and explore ways to abate them,
knowledge about other pollutants, particularly SOA and VOC
precursors, emitted by this sector is still scarce. Agricultural
activities involving fertilizers or pesticides are also known to emit
VOCs with high SOA formation potential14. However, the current
knowledge mainly considers the effect of ammonia on PM
formation. A recent study,17 testing scenarios of agricultural
emissions reductions, showed that in many densely populated
areas, PM2.5 aerosols formed from gases released by fertilizer
application and animal husbandry can dominate over the
combined contributions from all other anthropogenic pollution.
The authors showed that the impact of livestock and fertilizers on

An intensive atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) experiment was conducted simultaneously at six stations arranged in a cross shape on
the North China Plain (NCP) from 26 November to 26 December 2019. The impacts of the regional ABL structure on heavy haze pollution
and the relationship between the ABL height and aerosol accumulation layer (AAL) depth were discussed. Bouts of downdrafts generate
a persistent descending elevated inversion layer, helping the maintenance and exacerbation of haze pollution. Continuous weak wind
layers contribute to the pollutants accumulation, and low-level jets promote the removal of air pollutants. The unique landform
conditions of the NCP are reflected in its regional ABL structure and further affect the spatial distribution of haze pollution. Due to the
drainage flow and strong downdrafts, the western stations near the mountains have a colder surface and warmer upper air masses,
resulting in a more stable stratification and worse diffusion conditions; these stations also experience a thicker weak wind layer caused by
increased friction. Thus, the spatial distribution of haze is heavier in the west and lighter in the east. The convective boundary layer (CBL)
height declines evidently during haze episodes, usually lower than 560 m. Furthermore, as the vertical distribution of aerosols is mainly
influenced by daytime thermal turbulence and maintained at night, it is appropriate to determine the CBL height using the AAL depth.
However, the AAL depth is not consistent with the stable boundary layer height due to the influence of the residual layer at night.","INTRODUCTION
Frequent haze pollution events represent one of the most serious
atmospheric environmental problems faced by China, as they
result in poor air quality and low visibility1–3. Fine particulate
matter, known as PM2:5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic
diameter no greater than 2.5 μm), is the chief pollutant4,5. Haze
pollution shows considerable seasonal variations and regional
disparities. Seasonally, it is generally more serious in winter6,7.
Spatially, the North China Plain (NCP), the Yangtze River Delta
(YRD), the Pearl River Delta (PRD), and the Sichuan Basin (SB) have
been recognized as four major haze regions in China8–11. The NCP
has become the most polluted district in China12. And the effects
of its unique topography and local circulation on haze pollution in
the NCP have attracted wide attention of researchers13–19.
The formation mechanisms of long-lasting winter haze pollution
events characterized by high PM2:5 concentrations have been
investigated from various perspectives and on different scales20–24.
In general, persistent heavy haze events are associated with a high
emission background25,26, adverse meteorological conditions27–30,
regional transport31–33, and secondary aerosol formation34–36. In
particular,
the
meteorological
conditions
in
the
atmospheric
boundary layer (ABL), which determines the vertical transport of
heat, water vapor and aerosols between the underlying surface and
atmosphere, are crucial to haze dispersion37. Strong inversions and
stagnant winds are favorable conditions for the accumulation of
pollutants, and high humidity can contribute to the hygroscopic
growth and secondary formation of aerosols38,39. The diurnal
variation of the ABL can result in variations in the PM2:5
concentration40,41. In the daytime ABL, known as the convective
boundary layer (CBL), PM2:5 can be mixed uniformly in a thick layer
due to the active turbulent mixing42. While in the nighttime ABL, also
called the stable boundary layer (SBL), high PM2:5 concentrations are
often observed near the surface due to the stable stratification and
intermittent turbulence43–45. Moreover, pollutants in the residual
layer can be mixed downward to the surface with the development
of the ABL the next morning16,46,47. Regarding the dynamic structure,
low-level jets (LLJs) and turbulent motions can modify the air quality
by affecting transport and diffusion capabilities. LLJs can not only
contribute to the advection of pollutants to less polluted areas48,
but also improve air quality in the pollution dissipation stage
by
triggering
turbulent
mixing
and
transferring
momentum
downward49,50.
The atmospheric boundary layer height (ABLH) is an important
parameter in air quality assessments that reflects the effects of
turbulent mixing, convection and other physical processes in the
ABL51. Studies have shown that the ABLH is a main meteorological
driver of PM2:5 variation52. There is a negative correlation between
the ABLH and pollutant concentrations53–55. The ABLH in winter is
lower than that in summer, which makes haze pollution form
more easily in winter56,57. In addition, with the rapid development
of ground-based remote sensing equipment, such as lidars and
ceilometers, a number of studies have attempted to retrieve the
ABLH
based
on
the
distributions
of
substances58–60.
The
theoretical basis of this approach is that aerosols are abundant
in the ABL, but sharply decrease at the boundary layer top, while
the free atmosphere is free of aerosols61.
With the increasing attention paid to the impacts of the ABL on
haze pollution, many field experiments have been conducted.
Atmospheric profiles have commonly been acquired by meteor-
ological towers, tethered balloons, conventional radiosondes and
surface-based
remote
sensing
equipment47,62–65.
However,
boundary layer observations are still scarce overall, the influence
of the ABL structure on heavy haze pollution remains to be
studied. And most studies were based on single-statio

Open cloud cells can be described in ideal form as connected clouds that surround spots of isolated clear skies in their centers. This
cloud pattern is typically associated with marine stratocumulus (MSc) that form in the oceanic boundary layer. However, it can form
in deeper convective clouds as well. Here, we focus on deep-open-cells (with tops reaching up to ~5–7 km) that form in the post-
frontal regions of winter Mediterranean cyclones, and examine their properties and evolution. Using a Lagrangian analysis of
satellite data, we show that deep-open-cells have a larger equivalent diameter (~58 ± 18 km) and oscillate with a longer periodicity
(~3.5 ± 1 h) compared to shallow MSc. A numerical simulation of one Cyprus low event reveals that precipitation-generated
convergence and divergence dynamic patterns are the main driver of the open cells’ organization and oscillations. Thus, our
findings generalize the mechanism attributed to the behavior of shallow marine cells to deeper convective systems.","INTRODUCTION
The classic Rayleigh–Bénard convection1,2 describes a fluid flow
between two plates due to a uniform temperature gradient
(heated from below). Gradual increase in the thermal forcing
initially drives 2D roll pattern formation2 or 3D hexagons3, which
can then evolve into time-dependent flow, and finally into
turbulent convection4. These dynamics are recognized in the
atmosphere, especially over the ocean, by certain roll-like and
hexagonal cloud patterns5–7. In the subtropical marine atmo-
sphere, for example, heat from the ocean surface (the warmer
plate) is transferred by convection to the boundary layer top (the
colder upper plate), and shallow clouds organize into cloud streets
(rolls and linear clouds) or cellular patterns (marine stratocumulus,
MSc) that generate hexagonal shapes in their ideal form8. These
clouds cover large oceanic regions, and have a significant effect
on the earth’s albedo and the transfer of heat, moisture and
momentum in the lower atmosphere9,10. Cellular patterns of
clouds can appear as closed or as open cells. Updraft that forms at
the central part of the closed cell creates shallow clouds with large
coverage, whereas for open cells the updraft forms along the cell’s
walls, yielding thicker clouds with lower cloud coverage11.
Although the general patterns of the Rayleigh-Bénard convec-
tion can provide a first-approximation description of cloud
patterns, it is far too simple to capture the full complexity of
cellular clouds’ convection. A cloud field system is controlled by
interactions and competitions between thermodynamic, radiative,
and microphysical processes, and therefore forms a much richer
physical system. For example, in MSc cloud fields the air mass
properties and the boundary conditions are non-uniform9,12. The
presence of the clouds in the system dictates a two-phase (at
least)
problem,
including
additional
cloud
processes13
and
interactions with ambient meteorological conditions14.
The complexity of the cloud system leads to some discrepancies
between the classical Rayleigh–Bénard theory and observations.
For example, previous measurements of MSc cells reported a
typical aspect ratio (diameter divided by depth) of ~206,8, while
the theoretical value for Rayleigh–Bénard cells is between 1 and
39. Other studies highlighted the crucial role of rain in impacting
the dynamic and thermodynamic conditions, and hence the
organization and evolution of MSc cells. For example, the
evaporation of raindrops below cloud base generates a dynamic
response of cellular organization of updrafts and downdrafts that
promotes the formation of open cells15. Therefore, rain produced
downdrafts, can open closed cells by flipping their dynamic
circulation16–18. Other studies showed that precipitating MSc cells
oscillate with an average periodicity of ~3 h, while closed ones
(which don’t precipitate) do not oscillate, and can maintain a
steady structure for much longer17,19. On the other hand, there
were studies that suggested that cold pool dynamic forcing is not
essential for the organization of a cloud layer20,21.
Differently from shallow MSc cells (top at 1–2 km), there are
open cells that form under deeper convection conditions (refer
hereafter as “deep-open-cells”, up to ~5–7 km). One example,
which was rarely investigated, is deep-open-cells within the cold
post-frontal sector of winter Mediterranean cyclones. Rosenfeld
observed that these deep-open-cells are common within Cyprus
lows (Mediterranean cyclones centered near Cyprus)22. Other
studies that explored other areas around the global (like the
northeast gulf of Alaska) revealed that similar deep-open-cells
(cloud top up to ~5.5 km) are mostly a cold-season phenom-
enon23, usually produce significant precipitation24, and are linked
to squall-like patterns of the surface winds25. Again, like in the MSc
case, cold pools were suggested as a primary agent of clouds’ self-
organization, in both observations and simulations23–27.

Most of the world’s population lives in rural areas or small to medium-sized cities (totalling 68% of the world population), all of
which are impacted by distant air pollution sources. In Brazil, primary pollutant emissions have decreased in urban centres because
of government actions, while secondary pollutants such as surface ozone (O3) increased. In addition, O3 and its precursors can be
worsening air quality in areas already affected by biofuels production, especially ethanol. We provide almost 3 months of hourly
data (June 7, 2019 to August 25, 2019) for concentrations of O3, CO2 and other priority pollutants from a mobile station positioned
to distinguish among pollutant plumes (biomass burning, metropolitan area of São Paulo (MASP) and other cities). Although the
concentrations of O3 and CO2 were highest in the plumes from biomass burning, the MASP accounted for up to 80% of the O3
concentration in communities over 200 km away.","INTRODUCTION
High surface ozone (O3) concentrations pose a serious concern for
modern societies because they have been associated with
deleterious effects on human health1,2, damage to crops3,4 and
climate change5,6. Reversing the impacts of anthropogenic air
pollution demands actions aimed at reducing dependency on
fossil fuel in the transport, industry and energy sectors7,8. As a
result of attempts to reduce that dependency, limit emissions of
greenhouse gases and lower ambient concentrations of atmo-
spheric pollutants, the global consumption of biofuels, such as
ethanol, has doubled in the last two decades9.
By 2019, the participation of ethanol (hydrated and anhydrous)
in the matrix of fuels used by Otto cycle engines (in passenger cars
and other light-duty vehicles) in Brazil reached 48.3%10. Brazil is
the second largest ethanol producer in the world11, and the state
of São Paulo accounts for 55% of the sugarcane production in the
country12, sugarcane occupying 70% of the land devoted to
agriculture in the state (Fig. 1).
In the past, controlled burning of sugarcane fields was
responsible for considerable emissions of gases and particles;
government actions have limited that practice, leading to lower air
pollutant emissions in the state13. However, the material known as
bagasse (sugarcane leaves/sheaths) is used as fuel in electric
power plants, which are sources of atmospheric pollutants14,15,
generating emissions throughout the year. Paradoxically, the rural
regions of the state play an important role in improving air quality
in the large urban centres by providing cleaner fuels. Rural areas
may be affected by pollution from biofuel production, as well as
receiving air pollutants by regional transport from urban centres.
Unfortunately, without sufficient air pollutant monitoring data, the
important role that the transition from fossil fuel to biofuels can
play in mitigating the impacts on climate and health cannot be
fully understood. One limitation of previous studies is the paucity
of data for rural areas, which hinders the evaluation of the
distribution of air pollutants, especially O3, on a regional scale.
O3 is a short-lived climate pollutant (SLCP), with an atmospheric
lifetime of ~23 days16, hence it can be transported to other
regions. The most important contributors to anthropogenic
climate change, after CO2, are methane, hydrofluorocarbon, black
carbon and O3
17. Although several recent studies have addressed
O3 concentrations at sites within the fourth largest megacity in the
world—the metropolitan area of São Paulo (MASP)18—and in
urban areas of the state of São Paulo19–26, none performed an in-
depth analysis of the regional effects that emissions from the
MASP and the transport of gases from biomass burning have on
O3 concentrations. Long-range transport of O3 is seen in other
parts of the world. For example, Doherty27 and Lin et al.28 showed
the intercontinental transport of O3 from East Asia to western
North America and the flow of O3-rich air from Eurasia toward
Hawaii, based on long-term measurements performed at Mauna
Loa observatory. There is also evidence that regional O3 (averaged
over large areas extending well beyond cities) is increasing at
some locations, particularly in densely populated areas, as pointed
out by Madronich et al.29 who found a 6–7% increase per decade
in the Indo-Gangetic Plains, as well as in Beijing during the 2008
Summer Olympics. In Brazil, Boian and Andrade30 using the
Caltech–Carnegie Mellon 3-D Eulerian photochemical model (CIT)
showed the transport of O3 from the MASP to the city of
Campinas, 90 km to the northwest. The surface measurements
showed a second peak of O3 that the modelling showed to be due
to the transport of O3 and O3 precursors from the MASP to that
location.
In recent years, air pollutant emissions from thermal power
plants have increased because of greater demand, bagasse-fired
power plants generating ~25% of the energy produced in the
state of São Pa

Knowledge of hygroscopic properties is essential to prediction of the role of aerosol in cloud formation and lung deposition. Our
objective was to introduce a new approach to classify and predict the hygroscopic growth factors (Gfs) of specific atmospheric sub-
micrometre particle types in a mixed aerosol based on measurements of the ensemble hygroscopic growth factors and particle
number size distribution (PNSD). Based on a non-linear regression model between aerosol source contributions from PMF applied
to the PNSD data set and the measured Gf values (at 90% relative humidity) of ambient aerosols, the estimated mean Gf values for
secondary inorganic, mixed secondary, nucleation, urban background, fresh, and aged traffic-generated particle classes at a
diameter of 110 nm were found to be 1.51, 1.34, 1.12, 1.33, 1.09 and 1.10, respectively. It is found possible to impute (fill) missing
HTDMA data sets using a Random Forest regression on PNSD and meteorological conditions.","INTRODUCTION
Processes affecting atmospheric aerosol and its effects on climate
change are strongly dependent upon hygroscopic properties1,2.
Once a particle is emitted or formed in the atmosphere, it can
grow or shrink in size by water vapour uptake due to its
hygroscopicity, therefore altering the scattering and absorption of
solar radiation and consequently changing the Earth’s radiation
balance3,4. In addition, hygroscopic properties of aerosols play an
important role in determining the impact of aerosols in cloud
droplet
formation5,6,
indicating
that
particles
with
a
high
hygroscopic growth factor (Gf) mode are predominantly sca-
venged into cloud droplets with an activation efficiency of
57–83%6. Particle growth factor is also considered as a vital
parameter in determining the deposition of aerosols in the human
respiratory system2,7,8 as atmospheric aerosols at 200 nm can
grow their size to more than double when exposed to a high
relative humidity (>99.5%) in the human lung, enhancing their
lung deposition efficiencies.
Hygroscopic properties of aerosols can be described by
hygroscopic Gf that are commonly measured by a hygroscopicity
tandem differential mobility analyser (HTDMA) instrument1. The Gf
is defined as the ratio between the particle diameter measured at
a high relative humidity (RH) condition (dw, RH~ 90%) and a dry
particle diameter measured at a low RH condition (dp, RH < 10%):
Gf RH
ð
Þ ¼
dwðRHÞ
dpðRH < 10%Þ
(1)
The values of Gf have been widely used to classify hygroscopic
properties of aerosols into four groups: nearly-hydrophobic
(Gf ~<1.11), less-hygroscopic (Gf ~1.11–1.33), more-hygroscopic
(Gf ~1.33–1.85) and sea-salt aerosols (Gf ~>1.85)1. HTDMA
techniques are now used extensively to characterise hygroscopic
properties of atmospheric aerosols in different environments,
including rural, marine, remote, urban background, and roadside
areas2. However, there are some disadvantages of HTDMA
measurements: (1) a HTDMA instrument can only measure particle
growth factors for several selected diameters in a limited size
range (30–350 nm); (2) the measurement does not have high time
resolution; (3) possible bias if equilibrium conditions are not
adequately reflected8; and (4) the effect of condensed vapours on
the surface of measured particles creating internally mixed
particles and error in the HTDMA measurements8–10.
Particles released from different sources have different chemical
composition and sizes that determine their different hygroscopic
properties. Vu et al.2 reviewed the Gf of particles from three
sources, including traffic emissions, biomass burning and nuclea-
tion, and found that fresh combustion-generated aerosols are
predominantly nearly-hydrophobic or less-hygroscopic particles.
During the atmospheric aging process, aerosols can be subjected
to other aerosol dynamical processes which may change their
shape and chemical composition, leading to a change in their
hygroscopic properties. Kotchenruther and Hobbs11 found higher
growth factors of aged wood smoke aerosols (1.3–1.5) than those
of fresh wood smoke aerosol (1.1–1.3). Aerosols emitted from
traffic sources have sometimes been observed to increase their
hygroscopic growth factor during atmospheric ageing, but this
increment was much lower than that of biomass burning
aerosols12. McMeeking et al.13 used a HTDMA coupled with a
single-particle soot photometer (HTDMA-SP2) system to measure
the refractory black carbon (rBC) aerosol hygroscopicity and found
an influence of mixed rBC on the hygroscopic properties of
aerosols. Despite a considerable number of HTDMA measure-
ments for ambient aerosols in recent years, there are a few
modelling studies on hygroscopic properties of aerosols from
sources such as coal combustion or secondary organic aerosols.
Hygroscopic growth is affected by both the inherent hygro-
scopicity of the material comprising the particle, and for smaller
particles (<100 nm) by the influence of the Kelvin Effect upon
vapour

In the past quarter-century, Eastern North Carolina (ENC) experienced several devastating tropical cyclones that led to widespread
flooding and damage. Historical climate records reflect an increasing trend in the frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall events
across the eastern U.S., which is projected to continue to increase throughout the twenty-first century. Potential changes to
extreme rainfall across ENC are explored and quantified for 2025–2100 for three tropical cyclones using an approach based on
relative changes in future extreme rainfall frequencies (return periods) from dynamically downscaled projections. Maximum rainfall
intensities at ‘2100’ could increase locally by 168%, with widespread regional increases in total rainfall up to 44%. Although these
magnitudes exceed the consensus in the literature, the values here are comparable to the most extreme rainfall events observed in
the U.S. during the early twenty-first century, which suggests that the intensity of projected future events is already a present-day
reality.","INTRODUCTION
Extreme precipitation events driven by tropical cyclones (TCs)
disrupt the quality of life in coastal plains and low-lying
communities, where growing populations support important
agricultural, environmental, cultural, and economic resources.
Consequently, there is a broad interest in quantifying the potential
changes to extreme rainfall from TCs. Over the past century, the
southeastern
U.S.
has
increasingly
recorded
more
extreme
precipitation events1. Since 1910, much of the U.S. has received
a greater proportion of its total precipitation from intense one-day
rainfall events2. During 1958–2016, there was a 27% increase in
the 99th percentile precipitation3 in the southeastern U.S. During
1949–2018, TCs comprised 25 of the top 100, 4-day rainfall events
nationwide4; with one-quarter of the top 100 events occurring in
the final decade of the 70-yr record, at a far greater frequency
than in any other decade. Throughout the mid-latitudes, extreme
rainfall events will likely become more intense in a warmer world
from increased tropospheric water vapor5. The 20-yr return value
of the annual maximum daily rainfall—a measure often used in
urban planning—could increase by an average of 5.3% °C−1
warming with wide regional variability6. TC precipitation will likely
increase globally, and a 2 °C warming could increase the median
TC precipitation rate by 14% at constant relative humidity7.
Eastern North Carolina (ENC, Fig. 1) is among the most
vulnerable regions for TC impacts in the U.S. Since 1886, over
160 TCs have passed within 500 km of the North Carolina coast,
with a TC crossing the state every 2–3 years8. Additionally, the
coastal plains of ENC have a limited elevation range, enhancing its
vulnerability to prolonged flooding9. Since 1999, Hurricanes Floyd,
Matthew, and Florence set record rainfall and discharges in ENC
river basins4,10 (Fig. 1), resulting in historic flooding.
Global mean TC wind speeds, precipitation rates, and intensity
are projected to increase by the late twenty-first century7,11,12,
which underscores the need to examine how the most devastat-
ing storms in ENC may be enhanced by climate change. Recent
extreme rainfall events illustrate that rainfall probability statistics
based on stationarity assumptions can no longer represent the
rapidly changing climate10,13,14.
To explore changes in extreme rainfall at ‘2100’, the Design-
Rainfall Approach (DRA) is proposed, where observed rainfall
statistics are adjusted for changes in probability statistics derived
from the dynamically downscaled global climate models (GCMs).
Here, we do not explicitly model future hurricanes; rather, we
examine potential changes in storm total precipitation informed
by projections of future climatic conditions. The downscaled
projections reflect the presence of TCs, but their strength is
underestimated due to the resolution of the projections15–17. The
influences of model resolution and statistical stationarity are
mitigated with DRA by applying the probability statistics to two
dynamically downscaled future periods. Scenarios are used from
two GCMs: Community Earth System Model version 1 (a.k.a., the
fourth version of the Community Climate System Model–CCSM4)
(CESM)18 and Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Coupled
Model (CM3)19. Both models are members of the Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) ensemble20. The GCMs
are dynamically downscaled to a 36-km horizontal grid spacing
over the contiguous U.S. using the Weather Research and
Forecasting (WRF) model21 under two Representative Concentra-
tion Pathways (RCPs)22 to create three scenarios: RCP4.523
(CESM_4.5) and RCP8.524 (CESM_8.5 and CM3_8.5). None of the
data sets were bias-corrected; the individual model biases are
deemphasized because DRA compares the relative changes in the
projections between two future periods. Using the DRA is
proposed for quantifying potential changes in extreme precipita-
tion, which can be a prelude to quantifying floo

The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is predictable in climate models at near-decadal timescales. Predictive skill derives from ocean
initialization, which can capture variability internal to the climate system, and from external radiative forcing. Herein, we show that
predictive skill for the NAO in a very large uninitialized multi-model ensemble is commensurate with previously reported skill from a
state-of-the-art initialized prediction system. The uninitialized ensemble and initialized prediction system produce similar levels of
skill for northern European precipitation and North Atlantic SSTs. Identifying these predictable components becomes possible in a
very large ensemble, confirming the erroneously low signal-to-noise ratio previously identified in both initialized and uninitialized
climate models. Though the results here imply that external radiative forcing is a major source of predictive skill for the NAO, they
also indicate that ocean initialization may be important for particular NAO events (the mid-1990s strong positive NAO), and, as
previously suggested, in certain ocean regions such as the subpolar North Atlantic ocean. Overall, we suggest that improving
climate models’ response to external radiative forcing may help resolve the known signal-to-noise error in climate models.","INTRODUCTION
Groundbreaking work over the last several years demonstrates
that climate models can predict the North Atlantic Oscillation
(NAO) out to near-decadal timescales1–4. The key insight offered
by Smith et al. (2020; henceforth S20) is that decadal predictive
skill for the NAO only emerges in very large multi-model
ensembles4. Their team, scattered across the most advanced
weather and climate modeling centers in the world, built a
forecast system composed of decade-long runs of 169 ensemble
members across 46 start dates. Even with over 77,000 model-years
of output at their disposal, S20 still required post-processing to
overcome the unrealistically low signal-to-noise ratio in climate
models, tantalizingly termed the “signal-to-noise paradox”5,6. In
this paper, we will build on S20 by analyzing and improving our
understanding of the predictable component of the NAO in an
uninitialized very large ensemble.
A successful prediction of the NAO from the ensemble mean of
an initialized forecast system suggests that NAO predictability is
composed of two components in yet unknown proportions: one
from ocean initialization and another from external forcing7. All
climate model runs require both initial conditions and boundary
conditions. Researchers who run initialized forecast systems
prescribe initial conditions that are designed to approximate the
observed state of the climate at the time the forecast is initiated.
Recent literature refers to the act of using an observationally
based initial state as “initialization”. In the initialized hindcasts of
S20, consistent with much of the decadal prediction literature, as
the model integrates it incorporates estimates of observed
external radiative forcing. The uninitialized ensembles used here
eschew the incorporation of data from observations into their
initial conditions but are forced by the same time history of
external forcing. Averaging across a large ensemble effectively
removes the uncorrelated, internally generated variability and
retains the information common to all ensemble members. As
above, the ensemble mean of an initialized prediction system
isolates information from ocean initialization and external forcing.
The ensemble mean of an uninitialized ensemble reflects the
isolated influence of external forcing.
A careful comparison of initialized forecast systems and
uninitialized ensembles can therefore reveal the value of ocean
initialization. Analysis of the best available initialized forecast
systems claims, at a minimum, regional improvements from
initialization in upper ocean temperature, SST, precipitation, and
surface pressure7,8. In particular, ocean temperature in parts of the
North Atlantic subpolar gyre seems to have more predictive skill
than the surrounding ocean in initialized models and that skill
appears to be tied to the ocean circulation8–14. Ocean tempera-
tures may influence the NAO15–18, so it is plausible that ocean
initialization could improve skill in predicting the NAO.
There are hints that external forcing can be a source of
predictive skill for the NAO at longer lead times. In both models
and observations, tropical volcanic eruptions instigate the NAO to
move towards its positive phase19,20. In the mid-20th century,
there is a linear trend in the NAO index and this trend is one
component of predictive skill in the NAO (compare Athanasiadis
et al. 2020s Figs. 2c and 6c)1. In addition, on decadal timescales, in
the Community Earth System Model (CESM), an uninitialized
ensemble
produces
skill
commensurate
with
an
initialized
prediction system for two NAO impacts: North American and
western European summertime precipitation (as estimated via
field significance in Yeager et al. 2018s Fig. 5)8.
Using a 269-member uninitialized multi-model large ensemble,
in this paper we show that external forcing is the larger
component of NAO predictability. In the Methods section, we
provide further details of this ensemble and the methods we
employ to study it.

Sea ice melt and ocean heat accumulation in the Arctic are strongly influenced by the presence of atmospheric water vapor during
summer. While the relationships between water vapor concentration, radiation, and surface energy fluxes in the Arctic are well
understood, the sources of summer Arctic water vapor are not, inhibiting understanding and prediction of Arctic climate. Here we
use the Community Earth System Model version 1.3 with online numerical water tracers to determine the geographic sources of
summer Arctic water vapor. We find that on average the land surface contributes 56% of total summer Arctic vapor with 47% of
that vapor coming from central and eastern Eurasia. Given the proximity to Siberia, near-surface temperatures in the Arctic between
90°E-150°E, including the Laptev Sea, are strongly influenced by concentrations of land surface-based vapor. Years with
anomalously large concentrations of land surface-based vapor in the Arctic, and especially in the Laptev Sea region, often exhibit
anomalous near-surface poleward flow from the high latitudes of Siberia, with links to internal variability such as the Arctic Dipole
anomaly.","INTRODUCTION
Over recent decades, the Earth’s average surface air temperature
has warmed at a rate of ~0.2 °C decade−1 1. This warming is
unevenly distributed across the planet with the Arctic generally
warming at a much quicker rate; a phenomenon referred to as
Arctic amplification2. Arctic amplification is particularly pro-
nounced
during
the
winter months,
with winter
warming
exceeding that of the summer by nearly a factor of four3.
However, the enhanced warming rates in winter are largely linked
to changes in sea ice extent (SIE), a process that is strongly
influenced by the summer climate4–10.
Decreased SIE during the summer and fall seasons allows the
Arctic Ocean to absorb more solar radiation and increase the
ocean heat content9,11,12. This accumulation of heat during non-
winter months enhances winter Arctic amplification in two ways.
First, it limits the pace of sea ice growth in winter, resulting in a
greater transfer of ocean heat to the lower atmosphere9. Second,
the lack of SIE enhances oceanic evaporation, increasing the
amount of water vapor in the atmosphere13,14. Increases in water
vapor have been directly linked to increased downwelling
longwave (LW) flux which increases air temperatures and can
further limit winter sea ice growth in a positive water vapor
feedback process14. Consequently, identifying the mechanisms
that lead to enhanced sea ice loss during the summer is important
not only for summer Arctic warming, but also for winter-time
Arctic amplification.
Summer Arctic near-surface temperatures and SIE are strongly
influenced by the presence of water vapor and subsequent
downward longwave fluxes15. Understanding the sources of
summer moisture and their variability for the Arctic is therefore
critical for the attribution and prediction of Arctic warming
patterns. Several studies have attempted to identify the sources of
Arctic moisture using Eulerian approaches. Strong moisture
transport from the North Atlantic and North Pacific is shown in
Jakobson, Vihma16 with much weaker moisture transport coming
from land masses. Strong poleward moisture flux from the Pacific
was also found in Dulfour et al.17, while Luo et al.18 found the
North Atlantic to be the strongest source of poleward moisture
flux. Though Eulerian approaches have been widely used,
Lagrangian techniques are better suited to determine where
atmospheric vapor originated from since they are able to specify
evaporation source regions19.
One popular Lagrangian technique is the use of back-trajectory
analysis methods. Several studies have attempted to identify the
sources of Arctic moisture using back-trajectories and reanalysis
data. Some studies find that atmospheric moisture transport from
lower latitude oceanic regions is the dominant source of moisture
for the Arctic20, while others find the continental regions, namely
North America, to dominate summer vapor21. While these studies
provide a first-order approximation of the sources of summer
Arctic moisture, their reliance on back-trajectory analysis methods,
which involve an oversimplification of the model physics including
a lack of vertical precipitative fluxes, turbulent transfer, and low
temporal resolution, potentially biases their estimations of the
magnitude and location of moisture sources22. Additionally, these
studies find conflicting contributions of the land surface to Arctic
moisture, which warrants further investigation given rapidly
changing land surface characteristics across the globe23,24.
Here, we utilize a climate model with online water tracking
capabilities to examine the relative roles of different terrestrial and
oceanic regions in shaping summer Arctic vapor totals. Our results
highlight the key role of the mid-and high-latitude land surface in
driving summer Arctic vapor concentrations and the subsequent
Arctic warming. Based on these findings, we examine the
mechanisms that promote the remote land surface-Arctic climate
teleconnection. The quantification of moistu

Drought and heat stress affect global wheat production and food security. Since these climate hazards are expected to increase in
frequency and intensity due to anthropogenic climate change, there is a growing need for effective planning and adaptive actions
at all timescales relevant to the stakeholders and users in this sector. This work aims at assessing the forecast quality in predicting
the evolution of drought and heat stress by using user-relevant agro-climatic indices such as Standardized Precipitation
Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and Heat Magnitude Day Index (HMDI) on a multi-annual timescale, as this time horizon coincides
with the long-term strategic planning of stakeholders in the wheat sector. We present the probabilistic skill and reliability of
initialized decadal forecast to predict these indices for the months preceding the wheat harvest on a global spatial scale. The results
reveal the usefulness of the study in a climate services context while showing that decadal climate forecasts are skillful and reliable
over several wheat harvesting regions.","INTRODUCTION
Near-term decadal climate predictions represent an important
source of information with the potential to support decision-
making and strengthen the resilience of a wide range of socio-
economic sectors that are heavily influenced by climate variability,
change, and extremes1. For example, agriculture and climate-
sensitive energy sectors, such as hydroelectricity, wind, and solar
energies, can greatly benefit from this type of information2,3.
However, up to now, only a few studies4–7 have explored the
usability of these readily available near-term decadal climate
forecasts for specific sectoral needs.
The entire agricultural sector (food-producing systems, markets,
etc.) is influenced by climate variability, unfavorable weather, and
climate extremes (e.g., droughts and heatwaves8,9). In this context,
climate risk management10 for capacity adaptation, planning, risk-
mitigation, and early response to climate extremes can benefit
from decadal climate predictions. The advantage of using these
predictions compared to climate projections
relies on the
temporal coherence of the main large scale climate patterns with
observations11 and the possibility to assess their quality by
evaluating the performance of retrospective decadal predictions
against observations over the recent historical period1. The latter
aspect facilitates a retrospective risk assessment of recent past
droughts and heatwaves relevant for the agricultural sector,
improving the communication of the risks associated with those
extreme events for informed decision-making.
Climate information at decadal timescale holds the potential for
being of great value for a broad range of users in the agricultural
sector, especially in its producing component, who are affected by
climate variability and who would benefit from additional sources
of information. Wheat is the most harvested cereal crop in the
world (harvested area in 2019; contributing
to the local food security of many countries. Unfavorable
conditions and extreme weather such as heat or water stress
affect both grain yield and quality, especially when they occur in
the most sensitive development stages of the plant12,13. For
instance, heat stress occurring during the flowering stage affects
floret fertility causing a reduction of the grain number14, whereas
heat stress that occurs during the grain filling stage reduces grain
quality and size15. Similarly, drought conditions can affect either
grain number, when the stress occurs before or during the
flowering stage, or grain size, when the drought occurs after the
flowering stage due to its impact on grain filling16.
In the framework of the EU H2020-MED-GOLD project, the
durum wheat community has been engaged in the co-design of
innovative sectoral climate services based on specific users’ needs
and opportunities. This process has revealed some key decision
areas that could be improved by having reliable decadal climate
information available well in advance, such as risk estimates for
the global market, investments in agro-management infrastruc-
ture and tools, planning of supply chain contracts or targeted
breeding programmes3. Strategic tools in policies such as the EU
Common Agricultural Policy, designed to address EU climate
ambition, may also benefit from initialized decadal climate
predictions.
Recent advances in the understanding and forecasting of the
climate have resulted in skillful decadal climate predictions1,11,17.
Nevertheless, for the provision of an end-to-end climate service
focused on some of the above-mentioned specific needs of the
wheat sector, efforts are still needed to convert available climate
predictions into usable information by users. This study aims to
address this necessary step for the provision of a climate service
targeted to the wheat sector based on decadal predictions,
including the estimation of specific indices accounting for both
drought and heat stresses, their bias adjustment and their forecast

Globally, thunderstorms are responsible for a significant fraction of rainfall, and in the mid-latitudes often produce extreme
weather, including large hail, tornadoes and damaging winds. Despite this importance, how the global frequency of thunderstorms
and their accompanying hazards has changed over the past 4 decades remains unclear. Large-scale diagnostics applied to global
climate models have suggested that the frequency of thunderstorms and their intensity is likely to increase in the future. Here, we
show that according to ERA5 convective available potential energy (CAPE) and convective precipitation (CP) have decreased over
the tropics and subtropics with simultaneous increases in 0–6 km wind shear (BS06). Conversely, rawinsonde observations paint a
different picture across the mid-latitudes with increasing CAPE and significant decreases to BS06. Differing trends and
disagreement between ERA5 and rawinsondes observed over some regions suggest that results should be interpreted with caution,
especially for CAPE and CP across tropics where uncertainty is the highest and reliable long-term rawinsonde observations are
missing.","INTRODUCTION
Globally, thunderstorms present a significant hazard to commu-
nities, agriculture, and infrastructure. Recent analysis of the direct
economic losses as a result of convective events suggests that
over Europe and North America altogether, around 300 billion
USD in damage has been reported over the last decade1.
Thunderstorms produce a variety of hazards that lead to fatalities,
including heavy precipitation with flash flooding2, lightning3, large
hail4, damaging winds5 and tornadoes6. As direct observations of
many of these phenomena are sparse, a typical approach has
been to identify key ingredients necessary to their formation7, and
use them as a proxy for assessing climatological frequency and
intensity of severe convective storms, a technique well validated
by observations8–10. A proxy of convective available potential
energy (CAPE) is often considered, as it provides an approximation
to the theoretical maximum updraft speed (w ¼

) in
convective clouds11,12. The severity and longevity of thunder-
storms can be then characterized by the environmental wind
shear that governs storm organization13–15. Finally, to better
anticipate the likelihood of storms initiating in a favorable
environment, proxies such as modeled convective precipitation
are also considered10,16,17.
Thunderstorm frequency and intensity has been shown to be
changing regionally over recent decades18–22. However, how this
translates globally is unclear as many of these changes are linked
to complex regional circulation features. Our current under-
standing of future changes in convective environments induced
by a globally warming climate is that large increases to low-level
moisture (and thus CAPE) will result in the atmosphere being
more
conducive
for
severe
thunderstorms23–27
and
heavy
precipitation28–31. However, these projections have large uncer-
tainty with more recent studies indicating significant decreases
(~15%) to lightning flash rate under global warming or mixed
trends32,33, particularly in the tropics29,34.
This uncertainty raises the question of what changes have
occurred
historically
for
favorable
convective
environments
globally, and how do these compare to future expectations. The
availability of recently released global ERA5 reanalysis with hourly
resolution and horizontal spacing sufficient to sample local scale
convective environments, allows construction of a global clima-
tology and analysis of corresponding trends in the way that was
not possible with prior reanalyses35,36. However, as each reanalysis
features certain limitations related to model formulation, applied
parameterizations and assimilation techniques, a validation using
observed sounding profiles is necessary37–39. Thus, results based
on
reanalyses
should
be
always
interpreted
with
caution,
especially concerning thermodynamic instability and modeled
precipitation where systematic errors are present39,40.
RESULTS
Convective available potential energy
The climatological distribution of CAPE strongly reflects the
availability of low-level moisture. Enhanced CAPE is observed
over tropical and subtropical zones, excluding the high-pressure
areas over the oceans and subtropical deserts (Fig. 1a). The 95th
percentile (P95) of the CAPE distribution exceeds 5000 J kg−1 over
the warm waters surrounding the Arabian Peninsula (Red Sea,
Persian Gulf) and eastern coast of India. Over land, the highest
CAPE is typically observed over Congo Basin (P95 of around
3000 J kg−1).
Trend analysis of P95 CAPE over the last 4 decades indicates
significant decreases across tropical and subtropical zones, with
changes of as much as −200 J kg−1 (~5–10%) per decade (Fig. 1a),

Seasonal climate forecasts are a key component of sectoral climate services. Skill and reliability in predicting agro-climate indicators,
co-designed with and for European wheat farmers, are here assessed. The main findings show how seasonal climate forecast
provides useful information for decision-making processes in the European winter wheat-producing sector. Flowering time can be
reliably predicted already at the beginning of the growing season in central and eastern Europe, thus supporting effective variety
selection and timely planning of agro-management practices. The predictability of climate events relevant for winter wheat
production is strongly dependent on the forecast initialization time as well as the nature of the event being predicted. Overall,
regionally skillful and reliable predictions of drought events during the sensitive periods of wheat flowering and grain filling can be
made already at the end of winter. On the contrary, predicting excessive wetness seems to be very challenging as no or very limited
skill is estimated during the entire wheat growing season. Other approaches, e.g., linked to the use of large-scale atmospheric
patterns, should be identified to enhance the predictability of those harmful events.","INTRODUCTION
Agricultural production has been increasingly exposed to unfavor-
able climate events and extremes in the last decades1,2. Examples
of such extremes are heat stress, drought, and excessive rainfall3.
These events can lead to heavy reductions in, and even failures of,
crop yield quantity and quality4, with potential regional-to-global
consequences in the agricultural markets and trade patterns5.
Climate change is projected to further exacerbate this tendency.
The resilience of the agricultural sector can be enhanced by
developing and implementing dedicated sectoral climate services
to reduce risks but also seize the opportunities given by tailored
climate information. Seasonal climate predictions, with their lead
time up to 1 year ahead, offer a great opportunity to inform and
support farmers in their agro-management actions, e.g. on:
planning of sowing, selection of optimal crop variety, planning
of fertilization and field interventions, disease treatment, and
irrigation water use6. Seasonal climate predictions can also
provide valuable information to decision makers in relation to
market, trade patterns, development policies, and humanitarian
assistance linked to food availability and security7.
Seasonal climate predictions have been already shown to bring
added value for agricultural decision making in several regions of
the world8–11. Despite the potential farmers’ benefits of seasonal
forecasts12, they have been faced with many challenges to
adequately respond to end-users expectation, associated with
lower prediction skill in several key regions (such as Europe), and
the dependency between the skillful forecast time and the spatial
scale of relevant climate events13. The interpretation of probabil-
istic forecast uncertainty is also an important, yet still challenging,
aspect to be considered for an effective integration into sectoral
decision-making processes14.
The assessment of seasonal prediction skill and reliability is a
necessary step in the development of informative agro-climate
services. Usually, as a first step, the assessment is done for the
essential climate variables, being crucial for the understanding
and the limitations of the climate system predictability15,16.
However, the assessment of the added value for decision making
should be based on an integrated perspective, considering what
will be made available to end-users, for instance in the form of a
set of indicators addressing climate risks along the growing
season. Here, we explore the skill and the reliability of the
European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)
seasonal forecasting system SEAS516 in predicting agro-climate
indicators relevant for the European winter wheat-producing
system. We use a recently proposed agro-climate service Clisagri6,
developed in a co-designed approach with wheat farmers and
agronomists. We provide a spatial assessment of seasonal forecast
predictions at different stages of the winter wheat growing
season, discuss the predictability of different types of climate
events relevant for wheat farmers, and finally point to future
opportunities
linked to the
increased

of skilful
predictions.
RESULTS
Wheat phenology prediction
The main results point to skill in flowering prediction in central
and eastern Europe and Turkey already in the November runs,
when an entire growing season is still ahead in most of Europe
(Fig. 1). Lack of skill can be observed in most of western Europe.
Significant positive correlation between the ensemble median of
predicted flowering dates and observed flowering dates (i.e.,
simulated dates based on observed climate) characterizes eastern
Europe and Turkey. The reliability of flowering prediction indicates
usefulness for decision making especially for the prediction of
early and late flowering in central and eastern Europe. While, the
prediction of normal category lacks reliability almost in entire
Europe.

The result of Aethalometer model to black carbon (BC) source apportionment is highly determined by the absorption Ångström
exponent (α) of aerosols from fossil fuel combustion (αff) and wood burning (αwb). A method using hourly measured potassium to
calculate the αff and αwb values was developed in this study. Results showed that the optimal αff and αwb were 1.09 and 1.79 for the
whole dataset. The optimal α values in the diurnal resolution were also calculated with αff and αwb varied in 1.02 –1.19 and
1.71–1.90, respectively. Using the dynamic α values, the Pearson correlation coefficient between BC and potassium from wood
burning substantially improved compared to the results derived from the fixed α values. The method developed in this study is
expected to provide more reasonable BC source identification results, which are helpful for air quality, climate, and human health
modeling studies.","INTRODUCTION
Black carbon (BC) is an important aerosol component and is
primarily emitted from fossil fuel combustion and wood burning.
BC has strong absorption of light from ultraviolet to near-infrared
wavelengths1 and it contributes to global warming, following
CO22–4. Adverse impacts of BC on regional air quality5,6 and
human health7–9 have been widely reported. Considering its short
atmospheric lifetime (4–12 days)10–12, reducing BC emissions
would
have
synergistic
benefits
against
its
warming13,
air
pollution14, and adverse human health effects8,9. For reducing
BC emissions, it is important to quantify the contributions of its
various sources.
There are five methods to apportion the BC sources including
receptor model, radiocarbon method, Marco-tracer, air quality
modeling, and the Aethalometer method. The key strengths and
weaknesses of these common BC source apportionment methods
are summarized elsewhere15. Among these methods, the Aethal-
ometer model has the advantages of high temporal resolution
and is easy to be operated16. Therefore, it has been widely
adopted in BC source apportionment studies16–22. This method
uses the aerosol light absorption at two wavelengths to apportion
the equivalent BC (eBC) into fossil fuel combustion-related eBC
(eBCff) and wood burning-related eBC (eBCwb)16. The accuracy of
the Aethalometer model results is mainly dependent on the
absorption Ångström exponent (α) for fossil fuel combustion (αff)
and wood burning (αwb). Previous studies always applied fixed α
values in the Aethalometer model17,22–27. However, αff and αwb
varied in the ranges of 0.9–1.128,29 and 0.9–3.530–32, respectively,
determined by combustion efficiency33, mixing state of aerosol
components33–35, aerosol size36, and chemical composition37. It is
problematic to use fixed α values in the Aethalometer model.
Previous studies also showed spatial heterogeneity in the optimal
combination of αff and αwb. αff = 0.90 and αwb = 1.68 were
recommended in Switzerland38. αff = 1.10 and αwb = 1.60 were
adopted in Helsinki of Finland21. A combination of αff = 0.90 and
αwb = 1.82 was reported in metropolitan Milan, Italy39. The optimal
αff and αwb were reported in the ranges of 0.97–1.12 and
1.63–1.74, respectively, in the urban and rural areas of Spain40.
Therefore, the determination of site-specific αff and αwb is essential
prior to using the Aethalometer model.
To get the site-specific αff and αwb, previous studies used
auxiliary measurements such as radiocarbon (14C)16,38,39,41 and
levoglucosan (LG)20,21,40,42. 14C is an ideal tool to distinguish BC
from the combustion of contemporary carbon and fossil fuel43.
The constraint using 14C can precisely obtain the optimal αff and
αwb38,39. The attribution using 14C still has some issues such as
sample contamination, improvement in instrument analysis, and
the separation of organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon
(EC)43. These issues inevitably introduce uncertainty to the source
apportionment result. Constraint using the linear regression
between LG and eBCwb can calculate the optimal αff, while the
optimal αwb value is empirically chosen. The usage of LG to get the
optimal α combination also has shortages. LG undergoes chemical
degradation from the source to receptor44–46 and it has other
sources such as coal combustion47,48, cooking emission49, and
garbage burning50, etc. These sources would result in an
overestimated contribution of wood burning to BC. Additionally,
previous studies with 14C or LG to find the optimal α values were
low in temporal resolution, which was determined by the
sampling duration (i.e., >23 h)51. However, the BC emission
sources showed obvious diurnal variations, which suggested that
the previous studies with the 14C and LG constraints failed to
describe the dynamic variations of optimal α values within a day.
Therefore, a wood burning tracer with properties of chemical

The summertime Sahara and Sahel are the world’s largest source of airborne mineral dust. Cold-pool outflows from moist
convection (‘haboobs’) are a dominant source of summertime uplift but are essentially missing in global models, raising major
questions on the reliability of climate projections of dust and dust impacts. Here we use convection-permitting simulations of pan-
African climate change, which explicitly capture haboobs, to investigate whether this key limitation of global models affects
projections. We show that explicit convection is key to capturing the observed summertime maximum of dust-generating winds,
which is missed with parameterised convection. Despite this, future climate changes in dust-generating winds are more sensitive to
the effects of explicit convection on the wider meteorology than they are to the haboobs themselves, with model differences in the
change in dust-generating winds reaching 60% of current values. The results therefore show the importance of improving
convection in climate models for dust projections.","INTRODUCTION
Airborne mineral dust affects solar and infrared radiation1,2,
nucleates ice in clouds3, darkens snow and ice surfaces when
deposited there4 and is a health hazard5. Dust deposited to the
oceans and remote land can provide vital nutrients to the
biosphere6,7. Predicting dust on climate time scales is immensely
challenging; an analysis of 23 global climate models used in the
Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change has shown that they fail to capture basic features
of Earth’s dust cycle and past inter-annual variability8. Such failures
of dust models are due to a combination of the difficulty in
representing the land surface9,10, wet and dry deposition11, the
dust size distribution and radiative properties11 and the rare high-
wind events that dominate dust uplift12,13.
For the Sahara and Sahel, dust uplift is dominated by the
daytime breakdown of the nocturnal low-level jet (LLJ) as well as,
in the summer, haboobs generated from convective storms. In the
summer, when atmospheric dust loads reach their peak and
convective activity is at its highest14, haboobs account for 50% of
dust-generating winds in the southern Sahara15. Despite their
importance as a dust uplift mechanisms, haboobs are almost
entirely absent in models with parameterised convection16, which
has been linked to systematic failures in dust forecasts17 and the
inability of analyses to capture the summertime peak in dust-
generating winds18–20. The lack of haboobs in global climate
models therefore fundamentally limits their ability to represent
dust uplift and casts serious doubts on their ability to predict how
dust emissions may change in the future.
Convection-permitting models, which are run at high enough
resolution that the parameterisation of convection can be turned
off, are able to resolve large storms and mesoscale convective
systems with much more realistic organisation, as well as allowing
the explicit development of downdraughts and cold pools21–23. In
addition to producing haboobs, the improved representation of
convection in convection-permitting simulations has also been
shown to generate a weaker Sahel–Sahara pressure gradient that
is more consistent with observations16,22,24. This weakens LLJ
uplift and demonstrates the potential impact of improved
representation of convective storms beyond their direct impact
via haboobs. While long-term biases in climate models often
resemble average short-term errors in weather forecasts, until now
it has been impossible to examine how the absence of haboobs
affects climate change projections of dust emission. Here we use
pan-African
convection-permitting
simulations
of
climate
change25,26 to investigate how an explicit representation of
convection and haboobs affects both modelled dust-generating
winds and future climate changes in those winds.
Here we build on a previous study25, which presented future
climate projections of changes in extreme rain from 4.5 km grid-
spacing regional simulations of African climate (‘CP4’), alongside
an equivalent 25 km run with parameterised convection (‘P25’), to
quantify the impact of explicitly capturing convection, and by

generating winds. These simulations use 10 years of past climate
(1997–2007, ‘CP4’ and ‘P25’), and 10 years around 2100 under a
Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario (‘CP4FC’
and ‘P25FC’). Observed sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the
current climate are modified by a spatially varying increment from
the global parent model in the future run, to give two 10-year
periods that can be compared. Model setups are detailed in
Methods, but key to interpretation here is that the explicit
convection improves the entire West African monsoon26, as well
as the intensity of storms within it23.

In recent years, the interest has grown in satellite-derived hyperspectral radiance measurements for assessing the individual impact
of climate drivers and their cascade of feedbacks on the outgoing longwave radiation (OLR). In this paper, we use 10 years
(2008–2017) of reprocessed radiances from the infrared atmospheric sounding interferometer (IASI) to evaluate the linear trends in
clear-sky spectrally resolved OLR (SOLR) in the range [645–2300] cm−1. Spatial inhomogeneities are observed in most of the
analyzed spectral regions. These mostly reflected the natural variability of the atmospheric temperature and composition but long-
term changes in greenhouse gases concentrations are also highlighted. In particular, the increase of atmospheric CO2 and CH4 led
to significant negative trends in the SOLR of −0.05 to −0.3% per year in the spectral region corresponding to the ν2 and the ν3 CO2
and in the ν4 CH4 band. Most of the trends associated with the natural variability of the OLR can be related to the El Niño/Southern
Oscillation activity and its teleconnections in the studied period. This is the case for the channels most affected by the temperature
variations of the surface and the first layers of the atmosphere but also for the channels corresponding to the ν2 H2O and the ν3
O3 bands.","INTRODUCTION
The Earth’s climate is closely linked to the flow of energy in and
out of the Earth-atmosphere system. At equilibrium, the outgoing
longwave radiation (OLR) and the reflected shortwave radiation
(RSW) (W ⋅m−2) at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) compensate
the Incoming Solar Radiation (ISR) on average. Any perturbation of
this balance due to a variation of the climate drivers (e.g.
greenhouse gases), known as a radiative forcing, leads to a climate
feedback which attempts to bring the radiation budget back to
equilibrium1. A good understanding of the Earth-atmosphere
system and of its long-term changes therefore requires an
accurate evaluation of the radiative effects of the climate drivers
and feedbacks on the OLR. Considerable improvements have been
achieved in the last four decades through the exploitation of
spectrally integrated OLR from dedicated broadband instruments
(e.g. refs. 1–6). Different methods, such as the radiative kernel
technique7,8 and the partial radiative perturbation9, have been
developed to evaluate the contribution of individual variables to
the changes in the OLR from broadband measurements. While
these techniques are very powerful, they rely on an accurate
knowledge of the different parameters of interest. For instance, to
study the impact of O3 on the OLR, these techniques exploit
infrared satellite retrievals or model outputs, which can both be
subject to strong regional biases and inaccuracies.
Independent constraints can, in principle, be obtained from
spectrally resolved OLR (i.e. the integrand of broadband OLR, in
units of W ⋅m−2 ⋅(cm−1)−1) derived from infrared hyperspectral
sounders, which give access to the spectral signature of individual
climate processes and feedbacks. While the potential for using
spectrally resolved OLR (hereafter abbreviated as SOLR) for the
study of climate change has been known for some time (e.g.
refs. 10,11), the interest for these measurements has only grown
relatively
recently
with
the
advent
of
stable
multi-year
observations12. Among the latest achievements, important results
were obtained by refs. 13,14 and 15,16 from the measurements of
the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS, aboard NASA’s Aqua
satellite17). In particular, they identified a series of biases in climate
models that compensated each other partially, and did not show
up in comparisons with broadband fluxes. More recently, based on
an analysis of 10 years of AIRS global-mean radiances, Pan et al.18
calculated significant cooling trends in the carbon dioxide (CO2) ν2
band for channels sensitive to the lower and the mid-stratosphere.
Clear differences were highlighted in trends derived from
synthetic AIRS radiances computed by considering the output of
a free-running general circulation model (GCM) and the European
Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECWMF) reanalysis
data set (ERA-Interim), confirming the challenges in accurately
modeling and assimilating the stratospheric climate.
The infrared atmospheric sounding interferometer (IASI19,20) on
board the Metop satellites is a hyperspectral sounder like AIRS,
which has the advantage of covering the 645–2760 cm−1 thermal
infrared region without any gaps, which makes it well suited for
detecting changes in the Earth’s SOLR related to trace gases
variations. Because of their different overpass time (9.30 versus
13.30 a.m. and p.m. local time for IASI and AIRS, respectively), the
joint exploitation of the measurements from the different infrared
instruments (also including the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS)
on Suomi NPP which was launched in 201121 but whose
measurements were never used to date to derived SOLR) could
provide meaningful information on, for example, the diurnal cycle
of the SOLR or for the confirmation of the variations observed in
the SOLR. Since its launch in 2006, IASI has shown a very good
stability over time and its measurements provide a good
fundamental climate data record22,23. Among others, IASI is used

The West African Monsoon (WAM) is a complex system depending on global climate influences and multiple regional
environmental factors. Central and Southern African biomass-burning (SABB) aerosols have been shown to perturb WAM during
episodic northward inter-hemispheric transport events, but a possible dynamical connection between the core of the SABB aerosol
outflow and the WAM system remains unexplored. Through regional climate modeling experiments, we show that SABB aerosols
can indeed impact WAM dynamics via two competitive regional scale and inter-hemispheric dynamical feedbacks originating from
(i) enhanced diabatic heating occurring in the Southeastern Atlantic low-cloud deck region, and (ii) aerosol and cloud-induced sea
surface temperature cooling. These mechanisms, related to aerosol direct, semi-direct, and indirect effects, are shown to have
different seasonal timings, resulting in a reduction of June to September WAM precipitation, while possibly enhancing late-season
rainfall in WAM coastal areas.","INTRODUCTION
The understanding of climate variability in West Africa is of prime
importance for regional socioeconomic sustainability, especially in
the context of climate change and population growth. Since the
dramatic Sahelian droughts of the eighties, much effort has been
devoted to a better scientific understanding and modeling of the
West African Monsoon (WAM) system and its connection to global
dynamics and to regional
factors,
including anthropogenic
perturbations1. For example, at the regional scale, the Saharan
heat low and the South East Atlantic (SEA) cold tongue intensity,
land-use changes, and soil moisture feedbacks are important for
the meridional distribution of diabatic and moisture sources
impacting the WAM regional moist static energy gradient,
convective activity, and rainfall2. Absorbing aerosol particles,
which are emitted both naturally and as a result of anthropgenic
activity in large quantity over Africa, may also impact monsoon
dynamics through complex interactions with solar and thermal
radiation, and with clouds through microphysical effects. The
impact of mineral dusts present over the Sahara and Sahel during
the June to September (JJAS) WAM season has received much
attention in studies covering a broad range of spatial and
temporal
scales3–6,
On
the
contrary,
possible
impacts
of
biomass-burning aerosol emissions, which are mostly active over
southern hemisphere Africa during the WAM season, have
received less attention. A few studies have nevertheless suggested
continental-scale connections between the central and southern
Africa biomass-burning (SABB) aerosol radiative forcing and
tropical Africa precipitation, mostly attributed to the perturbation
of continental static stability7. Recent studies have also pointed
out that a fraction of SABB particles, once northwardly advected
over West Africa, could contribute to impacting the local climate
via cloud interactions8 or modification of local atmospheric
stability9,10, Here, we show that SABB can also have an important
effect on WAM through a regional inter-hemispheric dynamical
feedback originating from the highly concentrated SABB aerosol
outflow located over the South Eastern Atlantic (SEA) ocean (Fig. 1,
region A). This impact is shown to be associated with the SEA
semi-permanent stratocumulus cloud cover and involves atmo-
spheric fast adjustment vs. slower sea surface temperature (SST)
response to aerosol perturbation11. Over recent years, the SABB
aerosol outflow region has received much scientific attention
notably through the Aerosol RadiatiOn and CLOuds in Southern
Africa AEROCLO-sA12, the ObseRvations of Aerosols Clouds and
their interactions ORACLES13, the Clouds and Aerosol Radiative
Impacts and Forcing CLARIFY14, and the Dynamics-Aerosol-
Chemistry-Cloud Interactions in West Africa DACCIWA8 programs.
The combination of new observations and state-of-the-art models
(see e.g.,15.) implemented in these programs are shedding new
light on the SEA aerosol outflow properties and its interaction with
low-level clouds.
In this context, we use a suite of regional climate simulations to
explore the role of several regional scale interaction mechanisms

Several studies assessed the impact of inorganic P in fertilizing oligotrophic areas, however, the importance of organic P in such
fertilization processes received far less attention. In this study, the amount and origin of organic P delivered to the eastern
Mediterranean Sea were characterized in atmospheric particles using the positive matrix factorization model (PMF). Phospholipids
together with other chemical compounds (sugars, metals) were used as tracers in PMF. The model revealed that dominant sources
of organic P are bioaerosols and dust. The amount of organic P from bioaerosols (~4 Gg P y−1) is similar to the amount of soluble
inorganic P originating from dust aerosols; this is especially true during highly stratified periods when surface waters are strongly
P-limited. The deposition of organic P from bioaerosols can constitute a considerable flux of bioavailable P—even during periods of
dust episodes, implying that airborne biological particles can potentially fertilize marine ecosystems.","INTRODUCTION
Phosphorus (P) is critical to life on Earth, and its distribution in
marine1 and terrestrial ecosystems2 is shaped by many biogeo-
chemical processes. Inorganic P species (e.g., mono- or diproto-
nated orthophosphate) comprise the most bioavailable P forms
and have been studied for many decades. Organic phosphorous-
containing compounds (org-P), such as nucleic acids, phospholi-
pids, inositol phosphates, phosphoamides, phosphonates, phos-
phoproteins,
sugar
phosphates,
and
phosphonic
acids,
are
thought to play a critical role in driving cell growth and
metabolism,
as
well
as
the
community
composition
of
microorganisms3,4.
The org-P compounds are ubiquitous in organisms and thus
contribute to the P biogeochemical cycle4. Although in the
atmosphere primary biological particles (bioaerosols) are ubiqui-
tous5, the amount and speciation of org-P are virtually unknown.
Bioaerosols are composed of organic matter comprising cell
fragments, pollen (diameter exceeding 10 μm), bacteria (diameter
~1 μm), fungi, algae, moss, fern spores (diameter ~10 μm), viruses
(diameter less than 0.1 μm), and fragments from animals and
plants6. Tracer-based emission rates of bioaerosol (as PM10 mass)
for Europe is estimated at 24 kg km−2 y−1, with fungal spores and
plant debris being the most important contributors to these
emissions7. Dust also contains high concentrations of biological
material, mainly from microorganisms or plant detritus8. This
material may be enriched with additional biological loads (fungal
spores, bacteria, viruses, pollen, etc.) through the adhesion of
microbe-laden fine aquatic sprays to dust particles as the Sahara
Desert plume moves over terrestrial and aquatic environments9.
Global modeling studies suggest that desert dust is a major
source of P that contributes more than 82% to global P emissions
(1.4 Tg P yr−1)10. The contribution of bioaerosols to P is 12% and
could be as high as 45% in soluble P (0.5 Tg P yr−1, globally)11.
On
the
other
hand,
Wang
et
al.
(2015)12
indicated
that
combustion-related emissions of atmospheric P (1.8 Tg P yr−1)
represent over 50% of global atmospheric sources of P (3.5 Tg
P yr−1), suggesting that the perturbation of the global P cycle by
anthropogenic emissions is greater than previously thought;
however, these estimates are much higher than in other studies.
These assessments highlight the uncertainties in understanding
the role of atmospheric P in global biogeochemistry.
The Mediterranean Sea region has been identified as one of the
most climate-sensitive marine ecosystems, with increased vulner-
ability owing to the effects of the increasing demographic and
economic development occurring throughout its coastal zone. The
long-term impacts on biogeochemical cycles and the ecosystem
are highly uncertain13. Furthermore, the chronically P-limited
Mediterranean Sea14 is at a location, where anthropogenic
pollution transported from continental Europe interacts with dust
transported from the Sahara15,16, leading to a wide range of
nutrient solubilization and deposition flux throughout the year.
The eastern Mediterranean area is a low-nutrient, low-chlorophyll
marine environment where bacterioplankton experience P limita-
tion and phytoplankton experience co-limitation by nitrogen and
phosphorus in the summer14,16. The seasonal Saharan dust storms
enrich the atmosphere with plant debris, pollen, fungi and
bacteria17. The polluted air masses from northern and central
Europe, including summer biomass burning episodes are also
influence the air quality of the area. These atmospheric inputs,
with both natural and anthropogenic origin, represent an
important source of new nutrients for marine ecosystems18–20.
The source apportionment analysis of P species, their quanti-
tative impacts and the processes involved in the P biogeochemical
cycle (especially for org-P) are poorly constrained in the study
area. This paper estimates the source apportionment of atmo-
spheric org- P by using a posit

Consecutive failures in the summer monsoon rainfall led to widespread and severe droughts with profound implications for
agricultural activities in India. However, the likelihood of successive megadroughts in India’s past and future climate remain poorly
understood. Using Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) from the Monsoon Asia Drought Atlas (MADA), we show that the major
famines that affected millions of people during 1200–2018 were linked with summer monsoon droughts. Four megadroughts
covering more than 40% of the country occurred for two consecutive summer monsoon seasons during 1200–2018. The most
recent and severe megadrought occurred in 2002–2003. Simulations from the Community Earth System Model (CESM) for the last
millennium (850–2005) ensemble (LME) show that the likelihood of two and three-year consecutive megadroughts during the
summer monsoon is about 0.7 and 0.3 events per 100 years, respectively. Large ensemble simulations from CESM (CESM-LE) show a
decline in the frequency of megadroughts in the future. Summer monsoon megadroughts are strongly associated with the warm
sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies over the Pacific Ocean in the past and future climate. Substantial warming under the
projected future climate can cause megadroughts under near-normal precipitation during the summer monsoon season. Despite
the projected decline in the likelihood of the summer monsoon megadroughts under the warming climate, megadroughts in the
future can have considerable implications for India’s food production and water availability.","INTRODUCTION
Indian summer monsoon (June–September) accounts for more
than 80% of the total annual rainfall1. Rainfall during the summer
monsoon plays a vital role in the Indian economy2,3. The Indian
summer monsoon has a year-to-year variability of about 10% of its
long-term mean1,2. A rainfall deficit of more than 10% is
considered a drought, while rainfall of more than 10% of the
long-term mean is termed surplus2. A deficit of 19–21% in rainfall
in 2002 caused a drought that resulted in an estimated loss of
billions of dollars, which was about 1% in the Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) of India4. From 1901 through 2010, 17% of the total
years experienced drought during the summer monsoon season.
Characteristics and the occurrence of droughts during the summer
monsoon season are well studied1,4–8. About 18 meteorological
droughts occurred in India during the 1870–2018 period7. The
severe meteorological and hydrological droughts occurred in
1876, 1899, 1918, 1965, and 20007. While droughts due to summer
monsoon failure have implications, consecutive droughts disrupt
India’s socio-economic well-being. For instance, the drought of
2015–2018 caused groundwater depletion and affected about
one-fourth of the total Indian population7,8. Similarly, the drought
of 1875–1876 caused the great famine and affected millions of
people in India9,10.
The year-to-year variability of the Indian summer monsoon is
influenced by El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO11–16). Warm sea
surface temperature (SST) anomalies over the Pacific Ocean are
negatively related to the Indian summer monsoon rainfall (ISMR).
The negative relationship between summer monsoon rainfall and
SST anomalies is the strongest over the eastern Pacific region15.
The physical mechanism of the linkage between ENSO and the
Indian summer monsoon is associated with atmospheric circula-
tion and ENSO-induced SST variability17. The coupled atmospheric
and oceanic variability modify Walker circulation and connect the
rising motion over the central-eastern Pacific during a warm phase
of ENSO with reduced rainfall over India17. While ENSO is one of
the significant drivers of the year-to-year variability of the Indian
summer monsoon, other forcings are related to SST patterns over
the Indian Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, and other parts of the Pacific
Ocean affect ISMR. For instance, Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) is a
dominant mode of coupled ocean-atmospheric variability, influ-
encing summer monsoon18–22. A positive phase of IOD is linked
with the above-normal summer monsoon rainfall23–25. Moreover,
IOD modulates the teleconnection between ENSO and ISMR25,26.
At the decadal time scale, Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO)
influences the summer monsoon through a modification of the
Walker circulation and adjustment in the Indian ocean Hadley
cell27,28. Similarly, at a multidecadal time scale, Atlantic multi-
decadal oscillation (AMO) influences the summer monsoon29,30
through modifying the tropospheric temperature gradient17.
India has a long history of famines31–33. Famines caused
significant mortality due to lack of food availability, resulting
from crop failures and other factors9. The history of famines in
India reported in the scientific literature goes back to 503–443
BC31. Famines occurred in a large number in India during the pre-
British era. While the number of local/regional famines that
affected a small part of the country is considerably higher31, India
witnessed twenty major famines from 1200 to 1945. Out of these
major famines, nine famines were widespread and caused the loss
of millions of lives in India. The summer monsoon failures and
droughts9,31,33 caused a majority of the famines. Agricultural
drought due to soil moisture deficit and crop failure resulted in
food insecurity, which primarily caused most famines in India
during the British Era9,10. For instance, out of six major famines
(1873–1874, 1876, 1877, 1896-1897, 1899, and 1943) during
1870–2018, soil moisture drought9 was the ma

Between June 2019 and March 2020, thousands of wildfires spread devastation across Australia at the tragic cost of many lives, vast
areas of burnt forest, and estimated economic losses upward of AU$100 billion. Exceptionally hot and dry weather conditions, and
preceding years of severe drought across Australia, contributed to the severity of the wildfires. Here we present analysis of a very
large ensemble of initialized climate simulations to assess the likelihood of the concurrent drought and fire-weather conditions
experienced at that time. We focus on a large region in southeast Australia where these fires were most widespread and define two
indices to quantify the susceptibility to fire from drought and fire weather. Both indices were unprecedented in the observed
record in 2019. We find that the likelihood of experiencing such extreme susceptibility to fire in the current climate was 0.5%,
equivalent to a 200 year return period. The conditional probability is many times higher than this when we account for the states of
key climate modes that impact Australian weather and climate. Drought and fire-weather conditions more extreme than those
experienced in 2019 are also possible in the current climate.","INTRODUCTION
The 2019–2020 wildfire season in Australia was among the most
catastrophic in recorded history, causing severe social, environ-
mental, ecological and economic impacts across the continent. An
area larger than the size of the United Kingdom was burned
(estimates range from 24 to 34 million hectares1), including at
least 21 percent of Australia’s temperate forests2,3 and over 3000
homes1. Thirty-three deaths occurred as a direct result of the
fires4. Hundreds more deaths, and thousands of hospital and
emergency-department admissions, have been attributed to the
extreme levels of air pollution resulting from the wildfire smoke5,6.
The estimated death toll for animals is in the billions1, with fears
that some species have been driven to extinction7,8. Recent
estimates of the total economic loss to Australia resulting from the
2019–2020 wildfires are in the order of AU$100 billion9,10.
Two key factors have been linked to the severity of the
2019–2020 wildfires. First, the exceptionally dry conditions in the
years and months leading up to the fire season produced very low
fuel-moisture content, especially in eastern Australia11–14. The
widespread drought conditions have been connected to the
states of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean
Dipole (IOD) in the years and months preceding 202015–17.
Second, the extremely hot and dry weather conditions experi-
enced across Australia during the 2019–2020 summer were
particularly favorable to fire ignition and spread11,18–21. A number
of extreme weather records were broken over this period, which
included Australia’s highest national daily-averaged temperature
(41.9 oC)15 and record-high values of the Forest Fire Danger Index
(FFDI) in areas of all Australian States and Territories19. The
Southern Annular Mode (SAM), which was strongly in its negative
phase during the spring and summer of 2019, has been implicated
in the unusually hot and dry conditions across eastern Australia22.
Many studies have investigated how climate and weather
conditions favorable to wildfires in Australia have changed
historically and how they will continue to change into the future.
Paleoclimate records indicate an increase in the last century in the
occurrence of the fire-promoting phases of both ENSO23 and the
IOD15,24. These increases may continue in the coming dec-
ades25,26. Observed records since the mid-twentieth century show
a trend towards more dangerous fire-weather conditions for much
of Australia27–29 and a corresponding reduction in the time
between major wildfires30. Future projections of Australian fire
weather are strongly region- and model-dependent, but generally
indicate increased severity in southeast Australia31–34.
Estimates of the likelihoods of increased susceptibility to fire
from extreme climate and weather are essential for policy makers,
contingency planners, and insurers. However, such likelihoods are
difficult to quantify from observed records, which are limited to
approximately the past century and thus provide few samples of
extremely susceptible conditions in a given region28,35,36. There
was, for example, no direct observational precedent for the high
values of FFDI nor the low annual accumulated rainfall total
experienced in southeast Australia in 201915. Further, assessment
of likelihoods is compounded by nonstationarity in the observed
record, resulting, for example, from climate change. Even if past
likelihoods could be well determined from the observed record,
they may not be representative of current wildfire susceptibility.

Widespread aridification of the land surface causes substantial environmental challenges and is generally well documented.
However, the mechanisms underlying increased aridity remain relatively underexplored. Here, we investigated the anthropogenic
and natural factors affecting long-term global aridity changes using multisource observation-based aridity index, factorial
simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6), and rigorous detection and attribution (D&A)
methods. Our study found that anthropogenic forcings, mainly rising greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) and aerosols, caused the
increased aridification of the globe and each hemisphere with high statistical confidence for 1965–2014; the GHGE contributed to
drying trends, whereas the aerosol emissions led to wetting tendencies; moreover, the bias-corrected CMIP6 future aridity index
based on the scaling factors from optimal D&A demonstrated greater aridification than the original simulations. These findings
highlight the dominant role of human effects on increasing aridification at broad spatial scales, implying future reductions in aridity
will rely primarily on the GHGE mitigation.","INTRODUCTION
Aridity, and associated water scarcity, is a long-term hydrologic
and climatic condition, exerting pervasive influences on dynamics
in human society and terrestrial ecosystems (e.g., more frequent
hydrologic and ecosystem droughts, increased economic losses,
decreased land carbon sink)1–3. Recent studies indicate that
aridity, defined in terms of atmospheric supply (precipitation) and
demand
of
water
(potential
evapotranspiration,
PET),
has
increased globally during recent decades and is projected to
increase significantly in the future2,4,5. However, uncertainty
remains in the natural and anthropogenic mechanisms leading
to changes in such aridity. Natural variability (e.g., Pacific Decadal
Oscillation and El Niño–Southern Oscillation [ENSO]) has been
found to modulate large-scale aridity via atmosphere-ocean
feedbacks and atmospheric teleconnections6,7; however, the
natural variability alone cannot explain increasing aridification at
long
timescales8–10.
Overall,
anthropogenic
greenhouse
gas
emissions can enhance global precipitation11 and modify stomatal
conductance and plant water use12, likely relieving the aridity
stress; however, the ubiquitous increase in PET associated with
greenhouse gas-induced warming may aggravate the aridity13.
Thus, the net greenhouse gas effects on global aridity remain
uncertain and require further research1,12. Given the much shorter
residence time and more complex effects of aerosols than those of
greenhouse gas emissions14, aerosols have been identified as the
second-largest anthropogenic driver in the Earth system, partially
offsetting the greenhouse gas effects on drying15,16. Nevertheless,
the identification of aerosol aridity effects is challenging because
of their heterogeneous spatial distribution and direct and indirect
interactions with hydrological cycles17,18.
Defined as the ratio of annual precipitation to PET, the aridity
index (AI) has been widely used to characterize the degree of
meteorological drought4,5,13,19. Compared with other meteorolo-
gical drought indices (e.g., Standardized Precipitation Index and
Palmer Drought Severity Index), the AI is more climatically suitable
for the characterization of aridity/wetness condition and for the
classification of climate and vegetation over certain regions.
Moreover, the AI has been shown to closely correlate with the
changes of other drought types (e.g., hydrologic drought,
agricultural drought, ecosystem drought), although it represents
background climatological aridity more than specific drought
events19–21. Previous AI studies typically used a single set of
observation5,22 or merely model results23–25, thereby limiting the
robustness of their findings. Investigations of AI changes were also
primarily focused on the roles played by meteorological variables,
such as precipitation and PET4,23,26, without strict quantification of
the contributions from major human and natural forcings.
Moreover, little effort has been made to constrain future AI
simulations using multiple historical observations5,27, which could
induce significant uncertainty in the AI projections.
In this study, we aim to comprehensively disentangle the
human fingerprints from natural internal variability for the AI
changes during the 1965 to 2014 period. To decrease the
uncertainty of long-term AIs, we developed a collection of
historical

of temperature, humidity, solar radiation, wind speed, and
atmospheric CO2 concentrations. For both the global scale and
two hemispheres, a formal detection and attribution (D&A)
analysis was conducted to separate the individual contributions
from human activities and natural variability using optimal
fingerprinting methods29,30, the new AI products, and the latest

Mountain glacier systems are decreasing in volume worldwide yet relatively little is known about their upper reaches (>5000 m).
Here we show, based on the world’s highest ice core and highest automatic weather stations, the significant and increasing role
that melting and sublimation have on the mass loss of even Mt. Everest’s highest glacier (South Col Glacier, 8020 m). Estimated
contemporary thinning rates approaching ~2 m a−1 water equivalent (w.e.) indicate several decades of accumulation may be lost
on an annual basis now that glacier ice has been exposed. These results identify extreme sensitivity to glacier surface type for
high altitude Himalayan ice masses and forewarn of rapidly emerging impacts as Mt. Everest’s highest glacier appears destined
for rapid retreat.","INTRODUCTION
The worldwide retreat of mountain glaciers in recent decades is
well documented1 and the resulting loss of water storage capacity
for agriculture, hydropower, and both human and ecosystem
consumption have significant impacts on the 250 million people
living near mountain glaciers2. In addition, more than 1.6 billion
people are recipients of water from mountain regions and 50% of
Earth’s biodiversity centers are in mountain regions2. However, the
upper reaches (>5000 masl) of mountain landscapes have
received relatively little scientific attention leaving gaps in
knowledge concerning the key drivers influencing atmospheric
circulation, changes in snow and ice extent over time, and climate
model verification that together will decrease uncertainty in the
climate change projections needed to plan a sustainable future3.
Within the Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH) lie Earth’s highest
mountains including the foremost Mt. Everest (Sagarmatha,
Qomolangma, 8848.86 m). Despite its iconic status and having
been climbed >7000 times, Mt. Everest remains in its highest
reaches poorly understood in terms of weather, climate, and
glacier health. To fill some of these knowledge gaps National
Geographic and Rolex’s Perpetual Planet Everest Expedition
mounted in April/May 2019 the most comprehensive scientific
investigation of the Nepalese side of Mt. Everest thus far
undertaken, including studies in biology, geology, glaciology,
meteorology, and mapping4. This expedition resulted in (Fig. 1):
the world’s highest ice core - recovered from Mt. Everest’s highest
glacier (27.977211, 86.929861; 8020 m, South Col Glacier (SCG),
mean annual air temperature 1991–2020 = −22.6 °C); and the
world’s two highest automatic weather stations (AWSs) located
along the southern climbing route of Mt. Everest at 7945 m on
South Col and 8430 m on the Balcony5. In the following, we
investigate the timing and cause of the significant SCG mass loss
documented during our investigation and the implications for
high mountain glacier systems.
RESULTS
Estimated SCG thickness decrease and timing
Moraines surrounding SCG attest to the past larger extent of the
glacier (Supplementary Fig. 1) assumed to mark its Little Ice Age
position (1300s to late 1800s6). Except for seasonal snow and a
perennial snow/firn apron on the flanks of Mt. Everest, which form
the upper reaches of this southerly facing glacier, SCG’s surface is
primarily exposed ice. Logistic constraints (oxygen and weather)
restricted the time available to drill and package the ice core to two
hours resulting in a surface to 10 m depth retrieval of ice (average
density ~0.89 gm/cm3) from what is estimated to be its current
~30–50 m thickness. Aerosol-based micro-radiocarbon7 dating of
the upper 10–69 cm of the SCG ice core reveals an age of 1966 ±
179 years ago. Identification of annual layers in the SCG ice core,
using ultra-high resolution (153 μ) sampling8,9 of magnesium
(winter/spring maxima), as previously demonstrated for the East
Rongbuk Glacier ice core10 (ERG; 6518 m, ~5 km north of SCG),
reveals a net annual layer thickness of ~27 mm w.e. a−1 for the SCG
ice core (Supplementary Fig. 2). If we assume this is representative of
the last 2000 years, multiplying by the near-surface age this yields an
estimated net thinning of SCG of ~55 m w.e. ERG ice core annual
layer counted dating reveals an age of ~500 years ago at ~80 m w.e.
depth11 and a model estimated depth of ~2000 years ago at 108 m
suggesting ~50% less ice thickness for the same age at SCG. In
addition, estimated modern precipitation for SCG (Methods section)
is ~50% of the ~480 mm w.e. a−1 derived for ERG modern
precipitation11. While a definitive ice thickness loss cannot be

The intra-seasonal variation in precipitation isotopes shows a characteristic declining trend over northeast India. As of now, no
mechanism offers a consistent explanation of this trend. We have performed the isotopic analysis of precipitation (rain) and
estimated net ecosystem exchange and latent heat fluxes using an eddy-covariance system in northeast India. Additionally, we
have used a diagnostic model to determine the recycled rainfall in this region. We find a strong link between the enhanced
ecosystem productivity and isotopic enrichment in rainwater during the premonsoon season. Subsequently, on the advent of
monsoon, the Bay of Bengal generated moisture enters this region and depletes the isotopic values. Additionally, the regional-scale
convective activities produce periodic lows in the precipitation isotopes. Contrary to the general understanding, our study shows
that the internal factors, such as the local land-atmosphere interactions, rather than the external influences, play a significant role in
governing the precipitation isotopes in northeast India.","INTRODUCTION
A variety of ocean-atmospheric processes controls the isotopic
composition of precipitation. Since a significant amount of
atmospheric water vapour is generated from the oceans, the
physical conditions of the surface ocean leave their imprint on the
isotopic
composition
of
vapour
and
precipitation.
Post-
evaporation processes, such as the atmospheric circulation1,
condensation of vapour into raindrops2, and their subsequent
evaporation3, rain–vapour interaction4,5 also strongly affect the
precipitation isotopic fractionation. Convective activity, moisture
flux convergence, and cloud processes6,7 also modulate the
precipitation isotopic composition. Compared to oceanic produc-
tion, the continental production of moisture is relatively small;
however, it may be significant in specific areas depending on the
bio-geographical condition.
The oxygen isotopic (δ18O) profiles of precipitation on an intra-
seasonal timescale often show a declining trend in some parts of
India, such as Ahmedabad4, New Delhi, and Mumbai8, Port Blair9 in
the Bay of Bengal (BoB) during the monsoon season (June to
September). Such kind of declining effect is most dramatic in the
northeast region of India (henceforth represented as NEI; Fig. 1a).
For example, Breitenbach et al.10 observed a decrease in δ18O
values ca. 15‰ at Cherrapunjee, Assam. Sinha et al.11 reported
δ18O variations of Tezpur in NEI and observed a declining trend
over 10‰. The cause of such depletion in δ18O is believed to be
the modulation by ocean-atmospheric processes. A shift in
moisture source from the north BoB to the equatorial Indian
Ocean10 and large-scale planetary circulation was speculated12 to
explain the reducing trend in δ18O. Recently, Cai and Tian13
invoked the concept of westerly and easterly circulations that
produced higher and lower precipitation isotopic values, respec-
tively, in the head Bay region. Their hypothesis, however, cannot
explain the mechanism of generating the premonsoon high
precipitation isotopic values. The reported Local Meteoric Water
Line (LMWL) from NEI typically shows a slope like the Global
Meteoric Water Line (GMWL; ~8) but intercept higher than
10‰10,12. This shows that a significant amount of recycled water
vapour contributes to the local precipitation14. Earlier investigators
mostly ignored the origin and role of this recycled water vapour.
Here we analysed several rainwater isotopes profiles from NEI,
including a few other sites outside this region, to examine their
intra-seasonal behaviour and find a more appropriate alternative
explanation of this depletion. We propose that the land-surface
processes mediated by plant transpiration play an essential role in
controlling
the
precipitation
isotopic
behaviour
during
the
preceding phase of monsoon in NEI. This produces a strong
intra-seasonal precipitation isotopic gradient, denoted as LEMPIG
(Late monsoon Early Monsoon Precipitation Isotope Gradient). The
objectives of our study are: What processes control the isotopic
variability of precipitation in NEI on an intra-seasonal timescale?
Does plant physiology play any role in determining the precipita-
tion isotopic composition? Whether the internal processes or the
external factors
play
a significant
role
in modulating
the
precipitation isotope values in this region? We follow a multi-
disciplinary approach to address these questions. First, we
examine a comprehensive data set of precipitation isotopes from
across this region and analyse the regional meteorological
parameters. Second, we analyse the latent heat flux (LE) and net
ecosystem exchange (NEE) measured by an eddy-covariance (EC)
system, along with the reanalysis and observed rainfall data. Third,
we estimate the recycled ratio (RR: ratio of recycled to the total
rainfall) of rain on a seasonal scale to constrain the isotopic
observations. To better comprehend the precipitation isotopic
characteristic of NEI, we also present the isotopic data of another
urban, semi-arid r

Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) represents a major fraction of atmospheric fine particles. Both biogenic and anthropogenic volatile
organic compounds (VOCs) can contribute to SOA through (photo-) oxidation. However, the current understanding of their
combined, interactive effect on SOA formation and composition is still limited, challenging the accuracy in assessing global SOA
budget, sources, and climate effect. Here we combine laboratory experiments and modelling to show that isoprene can suppress
SOA formation from photo-oxidation of anthropogenic aromatics (toluene and p-xylene) with the presence of NOx, and similar SOA
suppression phenomena are observed when replacing isoprene with propene. We find that the decreased SOA in such mixed-VOC
conditions can be largely attributed to OH scavenging effect, resulting in reduced consumption of parent aromatics. However,
various changes in SOA oxidation state (i.e., O/C) and oxidation pathways (i.e., more carbonyls formation) are observed following
addition of isoprene, and the SOA chemical composition may not be similar to any single parent hydrocarbon, which implies the
existence of complex interactions between the degradation chemistry for alkenes and aromatics. Under the conditions of this work,
the OH scavenging effect is largely determined by gas-phase chemistry, which is expected to be widespread in binary or more
complex systems in ambient air. More broadly, we infer that the global budget of anthropogenic SOA and its corresponding
radiative forcing could be affected by biogenic emission of isoprene, particularly in urban environments with appreciable
vegetation coverage.","INTRODUCTION
The atmospheric (photo-) oxidation of volatile organic compounds
(VOCs) emitted from natural and man-made sources leads to the
formation of secondary species, notably pollutants like ozone and
secondary organic aerosol (SOA)1–3. It has been recognised that
SOA contributes a significant fraction of ambient tropospheric
aerosol4,5, which can cause serious air pollution6, damage human
health7, and affect Earth’s climate8,9. The global SOA budget is
highly uncertain, and bottom-up estimates of biogenic and
anthropogenic SOA fluxes are 12−70 and 2−12 Tg year−1,
respectively10, suggesting that global SOA is dominated by
biogenic sources.
Under ambient conditions, a variety of hydrocarbons from
different sources are SOA precursors and it is expected that
photochemical interactions would occur among them during the
SOA formation process10,11. However, in current chemical trans-
port models, the parameterisations that describe SOA formation
are based on SOA yields from single VOC laboratory experiments,
and it is assumed that the yields are additive across VOC
mixtures12–16. Compared to single-hydrocarbon laboratory experi-
ments, there have been limited studies to understand how the
presence of multiple hydrocarbons from anthropogenic and
biogenic sources—each of which is being oxidised to form SOA
—alters SOA formation pathways and composition10,16–18. There-
fore, laboratory studies under mixed-VOC conditions are needed
to better understand the sources and formation of ambient SOA,
which could help assess the impact of anthropogenic emissions
on the environment and climate changes more accurately.
Previous studies19–22 have shown that biogenic SOA and new
particle formation could be suppressed by the presence of
isoprene, which may be explained by the competition for OH
radicals between isoprene and other compounds. Recently,
McFiggans et al.23 found that the suppression of monoterpene
SOA yield in the presence of isoprene was caused by the
scavenging of both OH and low-volatility products by isoprene
and its oxidation products. This finding could be extended more
broadly to the real atmosphere that contains a complex mixture of
compounds, implying that the global SOA budget from biogenic
emissions could be lower than previous estimates24,25. Apart from
the interaction between biogenic VOCs, biogenic SOA formation
can also be affected by the presence of inorganic anthropogenic
species like SO2 and NOx10,11,16,26–28. A recent field study in south-
eastern USA showed that isoprene-derived SOA production is
directly mediated by the abundance of sulphate, while NOx can
enhance night-time monoterpene SOA via NO3 oxidation29. All the
above studies indicate considerable advances achieved in recent
years on understanding of how isoprene and other inorganic
anthropogenic pollutants (e.g., SO2, NOx) affect biogenic SOA
formation, through laboratory experiments, field measurements
and model simulations.
On the other hand, the effect of VOC mixtures on SOA
formation is not conclusive and may enhance or suppress SOA in
different studies23,30–33. For example, Li et al.31 found enhanced

East Asia will face a skewed monsoon cycle with soaring flood, drought, and weather whiplash risks in a warming climate. In our
objective eight-intraseasonal-monsoon-stage framework, we uncover a ‘dry-get-wetter’ paradigm in East Asia, contesting the fallen
‘rich-get-richer’ common belief. On timing, the Mid-summer and Fall periods are stretching at the expense of three delayed,
shortened, and weakened winter stages, especially near the end of the twenty-first century. On threats, entire East Asia will
experience up to 14–20 more heavy precipitation days during the rainy Spring to Mid-summer stages. Specifically, the Yangtze
basin will suffer from an earlier pluvial period with escalating flood risks. Moreover, societal security and ecosystem resilience in the
Huai-Yellow basin, South Japan, and the Korean Peninsula will be challenged by more frequent weather whiplash. Under the
monsoon-stage framework, a complete moisture budget decomposition sheds light on the causes of a slower precipitation scaling
and the ‘dry-get-wetter’ paradigm.","INTRODUCTION
The East Asian monsoon (EAM) is a subtropical monsoon system
north of 20˚N featuring a seasonal reversal of winds and a contrast
between rainy and dry seasons1,2. On a large scale, it is
fundamentally
driven
by
seasonally-varying
solar
radiations,
shaped by the land-sea thermal contrast and upper-level westerly
jets due to Tibetan Plateau forcing1,3–6. In recent decades, growing
concerns over future changes of the EAM in a warming climate are
warranted given its profound influence on the livelihoods of more
than 1.5 billion people, plus the large uncertainties presented by
climate model projections of monsoon precipitation, circulations,
and seasonality7–11.
Response of the EAM’s seasonality to future radiative forcing
has been analyzed commonly using precipitation-based monsoon
indices10–13. Multiple lines of evidence suggested that the future
wet season in East Asia seemed stretched with a remarkably
delayed retreat10–14 and at the expense of the dry duration15.
While
most
studies
focused
on
seasonal
changes
in
the
future10–14, there remains a dearth of research on the future
evolution of intraseasonal monsoon circulations and rainband
featured by the EAM system1,16, which are more relevant to
climate- and weather-related activities. For this reason, we follow a
recently developed circulation-based clustering approach to
derive the EAM annual cycle17. The monsoon cycle consists of
eight intraseasonal monsoon stages, among which the Early-, Mid-
, and Late-winter stages manifest in anticyclonic circulations and
widespread dry-and-cold air masses in East Asia, which are most
dominant in the Mid-winter. Following the Late-winter, low-level
southwesterlies become prominent in the south during the Spring
and a quasi-stationary rain belt is then formed in South China
during the Pre-Meiyu. The summertime southwesterlies peak in
the ensuing Meiyu season, alongside the strongest monsoon rain
belts lingering over the Yangtze basin and South Japan. The Mid-
summer sees a continent-wide weakening of summer monsoons
followed by the rise of anticyclonic circulations in the Fall, which
completes the annual monsoon cycle. A multi-model weighting
scheme is proposed to integrate the climate model outputs based
on their competence in reproducing the observed EAM annual
cycle (see ‘Methods’). Using such a framework, projected changes
in the monsoon onset, retreat, and precipitation will facilitate
more specific and comprehensive policies in optimizing irrigation
schemes, sowing and harvesting, reservoir management, and
climate adaptations in each intraseasonal stage18.
Another moot point lies in the causes of the climate sensitivity
of monsoon precipitation to greenhouse warming9,19–24. While
water vapors in the atmosphere largely follow the Clausius-
Clapeyron (C-C) rate (i.e., ~7% K−1)12,19,21,25–27, future precipitation
change is likely to scale at a much slower rate than that,
suggesting additional processes at work to offset the moistening
of the atmosphere. Scientists certified that the thermodynamic
effect
could
be
counteracted
by
an
overall
slowdown
of
atmospheric
circulations9,19,20,24,28,29,
plausibly
due
to
an
increased atmospheric static stability in both lower and upper
troposphere14,30,31. Paradoxical as it may seem, some studies
indicated that East Asia might expect both enhanced precipitation
and strengthened monsoon circulation manifested by an increase
in lower-level and upper-level winds32 as well as ascending
motions21. Apparently, further investigation on the attributions to
the future precipitation change in East Asia is much needed.
Seeing that the monsoon climate in East Asia features pronounced
variabilities within seasons, we show that the governing physical
processes could be markedly different in well-defined intraseaso-
nal stages, offering additional insights into the causes of
precipitation changes under anthropogenic warming, and bene-
fiting climate model evaluation and projection.

Paleo-proxy records suggest that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) exhibits a threshold for an abrupt change,
a so-called tipping point. A classical bifurcation theory, a basis of the tipping dynamics of AMOC implicitly assumes that the tipping
point is fixed. However, when a system is subjected to time-varying forcing (e.g., AMOC exposed to ice meltwater) an actual tipping
point can be overshot due to delayed tipping, referred to as the slow passage effect. Here, using an Earth system model of
intermediate complexity and a low-order model with freshwater forcing, we show that the tipping point of AMOC is largely delayed
by the slow passage effect. It causes a large tipping lag of up to 1300 years, and strongly relaxes the abruptness of tipping as well.
We further demonstrate that the tipping modulation can actively occur in past, present, and future climates by quantifying the
effect during Dansgaard-Oeschger events, meltwater pulse 1A (MWP-1A), and current Greenland ice sheet melting. The suggested
slow passage effect may explain the observed lagged AMOC collapse to MWP-1A of about 1000 years and provides implications
tipping risk in the future.","INTRODUCTION
The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) has a
significant impact on the Earth’s climate by conveying a large
amount of heat northward1–4. Its change has a broad climatic
impact on the globe, such as on surface temperature, rainfall
patterns, and sea ice5–8. Paleo-proxy records indicate that melt-
water pulses released from ice melt induce variations in the AMOC
and resulted in abrupt climate change in the past2,9–11. Moreover,
the weakened AMOC shown in future climate simulations can
significantly modulate the surface warming pattern (e.g., North
Atlantic warming hole) response to global warming6–8.
One of the profound features of AMOC is that it has a certain
threshold for abrupt change to occur12–14. The prototype model
for the AMOC, Stommel’s box model12, offers a classic example. It
predicts an abrupt change in the AMOC at a certain level of
freshwater forcing by transitioning from a stable state to another,
and the threshold is mathematically identified as a bifurcation
point. Such thresholds of a system where small perturbation can
induce an abrupt and significant change are more generally
referred to as a “tipping point”. For the AMOC, these are found in a
hierarchy of models, including conceptual models12,15, Earth
system models of intermediate complexity15–17, and even some
fully coupled global climate models18,19. Especially, the bias-
corrected National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)
Community Climate System Model (CCSM) showed the rapid
collapse of AMOC under doubled atmospheric CO2 concentration
level19.
The AMOC is exposed to a changing environment (e.g.,
meltwater pulses from ice), thus, its tipping point should be
considered in the context of the response to time-varying external
forcing (e.g., freshwater forcing). However, many previous studies
rely on the assumption that the AMOC is in a quasi-equilibrium
state under transient forcing (i.e., fast adjustment compared to
forcing time scale) and do not carefully consider the role of the
rate of external forcing16,20. Such an approximation may not
properly represent the response of the AMOC in a changing
climate. From the dynamical system point of view, once the
forcing becomes time-dependent, the dynamical system becomes
non-autonomous, and new dynamical phenomena appear. When
time-varying parameters (e.g., in the forcing) occur, the bifurcation
point of the dynamical system can be delayed compared to its
bifurcation point under constant parameters, as the state of the
system fails to instantaneously adjust to a time-varying parameter.
Such an effect is often referred to as bifurcation delay or slow
passage effect21,22 and is ubiquitous in natural phenomena23–26.
In this study, we investigated AMOC tipping under transient
freshwater forcing over a broad range of forcing time scales from
decadal to multi-millennial. A series of transient freshwater forcing
experiments were performed using Stommel’s model and an Earth
system model of intermediate complexity, and the impact of the
freshwater forcing rate on AMOC tipping was analyzed. We found
that the tipping point (i.e., freshwater threshold for an abrupt
change), timing, and its abruptness are significantly modulated by
transient freshwater flux forcing (FWF), and this variation is
denoted as dynamic tipping modulation of the AMOC. Further-
more, we provide examples of the freshwater forcing rates of past,
present, and future climate, and demonstrate how tipping
modulation operates in a changing climate.
RESULTS
Fundamentals of tipping under stationary freshwater forcing
To obtain basic insights into the tipping process of the AMOC, first,
we discuss tipping under stationary freshwater forcing using
Stommel’s model12,27, a conceptual AMOC model. In the model,
the AMOC is based on salinity and temperature differences
between low- and high-latitude ocean boxes (see “Methods”).

The sixth Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment report confirms that global warming drives widespread
changes in the global terrestrial hydrological cycle, and that changes are regionally diverse. However, reported trends and changes
in the hydrological cycle suffer from significant inconsistencies. This is associated with the lack of a rigorous observationally-based
assessment of simultaneous trends in the different components of the hydrological cycle. Here, we reconcile these different
estimates of historical changes by simultaneously analysing trends in all the major components of the hydrological cycle, coupled
with vegetation greenness for the period 1980–2012. We use observationally constrained, conserving estimates of the closure of
the hydrological cycle, combined with a data assimilation approach and observationally-driven uncertainty estimates. We find
robust changes in the hydrological cycle across more than 50% of the land area, with evapotranspiration (ET) changing the most
and precipitation (P) the least. We find many instances of unambiguous trends in ET and runoff (Q) without robust trends in P, a
result broadly consistent with a “wet gets wetter, but dry does not get drier”. These findings provide important opportunities for
water resources management and climate risk assessment over a significant fraction of the land surface where hydrological trends
have previously been uncertain.","INTRODUCTION
Understanding how the future hydrological cycle will change at
regional scales is crucial for impact assessment and adaptation
planning1. Previous research has produced apparently conflicting
insights on how land hydrological conditions have changed2–5,
ranging from increasing aridity over land6 and further drying in the
world’s driest regions7–9, to the acceleration of the hydrological
cycle10 and increased vegetation “greening” (implying relaxation in
water-limitations)11–15. Some studies have suggested that hydro-
logical cycle trends are consistent with ‘wet gets wetter and dry
gets drier’9,16, while others have found that both this and the
opposite pattern ‘dry gets wetter and wet gets drier’ is detectable
on land3,17. These conflicting findings may stem from different
interpretations of ‘drying’, ‘aridity’ and ‘intensification’, depending
on the metrics and spatial-scale aggregation methods used4,18.
Changes in the terrestrial hydrological cycle have typically been
explored by examining trends in just one3,5,9,10,19–21, or a
subset16,22–32 of its components, or in aridity metrics that do not
capture the full complexity of changes4. Furthermore, many studies
use a single-source dataset, so that results are very sensitive to
dataset choice2,4,24,33 and its inherent uncertainties4,21. Here, we
undertake a simultaneous analysis of trends in all components of
the hydrological cycle and vegetation greenness (based on
Normalised Difference Vegetation Index; NDVI), using global
observationally-derived gridded datasets of P, ET, Q and change
in total water storage (ΔTWS) that are constrained with in situ
measurements
(Supplementary
Table
1),
over
the
period
1980–2012. Crucially, our approach imposes physical conservation
constraints in calculating trends. The analysis of trends utilises
multiple products and observational sources in the derivation of
each budget component, as well as uncertainty bounds informed
by observational constraints. Sampling within these uncertainty
estimates was used to determine the robustness of the trend (see
Methods). Changes in the hydrological cycle are described at the
grid scale (0.25°) and over precipitation regimes derived by
clustering the land based on precipitation mean and variability
(Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 2).
RESULTS
Global patterns of change in the hydrological cycle
We first examine the spatial distribution of robust trends in P, Q,
ET, and NDVI over 1980–2012 (Fig. 1 – dark blue and red). We find
that 51% of the land surface has experienced robust changes in at
least one component of the hydrological cycle. P has changed
robustly across ~13% of the land compared to ~34% and 20% for
ET and Q, respectively. Regionally, P and Q show a broad tendency
for increases in parts of the Sahel, southern Africa, Eurasia, the
Amazon, southeast Asia and northern Australia. Declines in both P
and Q are detected in southwestern North America, southern
South America and parts of Asia. However, robust trends in P (dark
colours in Fig. 1) are more limited in spatial extent and less
spatially coherent than in Q. ET shows robust increases in most of
Eurasia, southern Asia, and western North America. Declines in ET
are detected in central Africa, western North America, the Middle
East, and central South America. ET increases in northern mid- and
high- latitudes and central South America are consistent with
greening trends (i.e. an increase in maximum NDVI14, and a
lengthening of the growing season). We also detect greening
trends in some regions where no robust changes in the
hydrological cycle are observed, particularly in Australia (Fig. 1).
The observed robust trends in P, ET and Q, while being less
spatially widespread than previously reported changes in these
hydroclimatic variables, do agree with many earlier studies on

The weakening of zonal atmospheric circulation, a widely accepted projection of climate change in response to global warming,
features a weakening of the Indian Ocean Walker circulation (IWC), with an anomalous ascending motion over the western and
anomalous descending motion over the eastern Indian Ocean. The projected IWC weakening has previously been attributed to
slower warming in the east than the west, that is, to a positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)-like warming pattern. However, such a
warming pattern can also be induced by IWC weakening. As a result, the cause-and-effect relationship cannot be easily determined,
and the projected change is poorly constrained and highly uncertain. Here, using a suite of coupled climate model simulations
under a high-emission scenario, we find that the IWC slowdown is accompanied by not only a positive IOD-like warming pattern
but also anomalous meridional circulation that is associated with anomalous descending motion over the eastern Indian Ocean. We
further show that the anomalous local meridional circulation is closely linked to enhanced land-sea thermal contrast and is unlikely
to result from the positive IOD-like warming pattern, suggesting that the IWC weakening is in part driven by the anomalous local
meridional circulation. Our findings underscore the important role of local meridional circulation changes in modulating future IWC
changes.","INTRODUCTION
Predicting changes in the pattern of atmospheric circulation and
associated atmospheric teleconnections over the tropics is critical
for agriculture, water resources, and ecosystem management. The
Walker circulation consists of the zonal atmospheric overturning
cells over the tropics with surface westerlies (easterlies) over the
equatorial Indian (Pacific) Ocean1. Variations in the structure of the
Walker circulations are closely tied not only to precipitation and
ocean temperature patterns2–5 but also to fishery stocks through
variations in nutrient supply caused by the upwelling of cold
water6. Recent studies of the Walker circulation over the Indo-
Pacific region have conflictingly suggested either a weakening6–16
or strengthening1,3,4,17–24 pattern in response to global warming.
Recent findings have also indicated changes in the Walker
circulation using various paleo-proxy datasets and model simula-
tions of the past climate25–28.
Model-simulated
weakening
of
the
Walker
circulation
in
response to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations has been
attributed to a differential increasing rate between precipitation
(~3%/K) and atmospheric water vapor (~7%/K)9,10. However, the
changes in the zonal overturning circulation in the tropics can also
be explained by enhanced dry static stability over non-convective
regions29, an influence of solar cycle maxima30, mean vertical
advection of stratospheric change31, and trans-basin sea surface
temperature (SST) differences12,21,32. In addition, several other
factors also contribute to zonal circulation changes. For example,
the meridional atmospheric circulation in the Pacific Ocean, which
is controlled by the anomalously high-pressure centered at mid-
latitude, acts to strengthen the ascending branch over the
western Pacific Ocean and contributes to the strengthening of
the Walker circulation20. However, no existing study addresses the
contribution of meridional circulation to zonal circulation changes
over the Indian Ocean (IO). Thus, it is essential to understand the
underlying physical mechanism of how the local meridional
circulation contributes to the zonal circulation changes over the IO
in a warming world. Furthermore, it is important to find out if the
SST warming pattern plays role in the weakening of zonal
circulation or whether the weakening of zonal circulation causes
the SST warming pattern.
The IO Walker circulation (IWC) is characterized by a rising
motion over the eastern IO (EIO) and a sinking motion over the
western IO (WIO)33. Presently, inter-annual variability of IWC is
closely linked to IO Dipole (IOD) events6,33–36. A positive (negative)
IOD, characterized by lower (higher) than normal SSTs in the
tropical EIO and higher (lower) than normal SSTs in the WIO37,38, is
often associated with a weakened33,39,40 (strengthened41) IWC,
similar to how El-Niño (La-Niña) events weaken (strengthen) the
zonal
circulation
in
the
Pacific
Ocean42,43.
Climate
model
simulations forced by a high greenhouse gas emission scenario
(Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5)) indicate
increased occurrences of extreme positive IOD (pIOD) events by
almost a factor of three44,45, which is thought to imply a
weakening of the IWC in a warmer world33,46.
However,
the
reliability
of
such

has
been
questioned due to common model biases in the IO47–50. In
comparison to observation, climate models exhibit stronger
easterly winds over the equatorial IO, a larger west-east SST
gradient, and a shallower thermocline in the EIO47,48. Previously,
an “emergent constraints” approach was used to investigate the
relationship between present-day errors and future climate
projections, with the conclusion that the model’s projection of

Sea ice extent (SIE) in the Weddell Sea attained exceptionally low levels in April (1.97 million km2) and May (3.06 million km2) 2019,
with the values being ~22% below the long-term mean. Using in-situ, satellite and atmospheric reanalysis data, we show the large
negative SIE anomalies were driven by the passage of a series of intense and explosive polar cyclones (with record low pressure),
also known as atmospheric ‘bombs’, which had atmospheric rivers on their eastern flanks. These storms led to the poleward
propagation of record-high swell and wind waves (~9.6 m), resulting in southward ice advection (~50 km). Thermodynamic
processes also played a part, including record anomalous atmospheric heat (>138 W m−2) and moisture (>300 kg m−1s−1) fluxes
from midlatitudes, along with ocean mixed-layer warming (>2 °C). The atmospheric circulation anomalies were associated with an
amplified wave number three pattern leading to enhanced meridional flow between midlatitudes and the Antarctic.","INTRODUCTION
The Weddell Sea sea ice cover is an important component of the
Earth’s climate system and influences planetary albedo, ocean-
atmosphere interaction and circulation, weather patterns1–3,
global ocean water mass characteristics4,5, ice shelf and ice sheet
stability6, the marine-cryosphere ecosystem7–10, primary produc-
tion, biogeochemical processes11, and shipping/logistic opera-
tions12. At the sea ice maximum in September, the sea ice extent
(SIE) in the Weddell Sea represents ~36.7% of the total Antarctica
sea ice cover, and the area contains the largest percentage of
Antarctic multiyear sea ice of any sector of the Southern Ocean13
(Supplementary Fig. 1). Nearly four decades (1979–2020) of sea ice
observations from passive microwave satellite instruments indi-
cate a moderate increase of 0.43 ± 0.4% per decade in the
Antarctic SIE with spatially variable patterns of increasing and
decreasing trends in different sectors. The observed variability has
been attributed to a number of complex physical processes that
include atmospheric circulation associated with zonal wave
number three (ZW3)14–19, upper ocean temperature and salinity
feedback20,21, regional wind driven sea ice drift22, ozone deple-
tion, stratospheric cooling23–26 and large-scale surface climate
oscillators such as the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and El Niño
Southern Oscillation (ENSO)27–33. In the recent decades, the SAM is
modulated by stratospheric ozone depletion resulting surface
climate change in the Antarctic and Southern Ocean25. This
climate change driven trend has led to intensification and
poleward movement of westerly winds, upper ocean freshening
and
cooling
of
the
Southern
Ocean,
resulting

growth20,21,28. Several studies using coupled climate models
showed the Antarctic sea ice decline in response to increase in
the SAM34,35. From the research to date, it is difficult to draw
definite conclusions regarding the causative physical mechanisms
behind the observed sea ice changes. Therefore, the physical
processes driving the sea ice changes may not be represented
correctly in climate models due to complex ocean-ice-atmosphere
interactions, limiting our confidence in the projections of sea ice
changes over the coming decades.
Following the moderate increase in SIE from 1979 to 2015, a
sudden decrease occurred in spring 2016 with the largest ice loss
being in the Weddell Sea36–39. It is essential to understand the
ocean-atmospheric processes that trigger such rapid declines in
order to ensure their simulation in models. The Weddell Sea
summer SIE and sea ice concentration (SIC) reached their
minimum in 2016‒2017, which was attributed to polar cyclones
with
record
low
central
mean

level
pressure
(MSLP),
reappearance of a polynya, upper ocean warming, and westerly
wind strengthening that advected multi-year ice out of the
northern Weddell Sea36. Several deep cyclones and ocean eddies
led to divergence in the sea ice cover and to anomalously record
low sea ice conditions over the Weddell Sea and Lazarev Sea.
There was also the reoccurrence of a polynya in 2016 and
201718,40,41. This took place in association with an amplification of
the atmospheric ZW3 pattern around Antarctica. A significant
amount of heat and moisture was transported from midlatitudes
through ZW3-linked atmospheric rivers that resulted in melting of
Weddell Sea sea ice during 201719.
In the Southern Hemisphere the maximum amplitude of the
zonal waves is located approximately between 45°S and 50°S and
the waves have an impact on the sea ice14,15,18,42. An enhancement
of the ZW3 feature with meridional transports of heat and moisture
fluxes had significant impacts on the Antarctic sea ice through
changes in surface temperature43. The ZW3 pattern drives the
poleward (ascending branch of troughs) and equatorward (des-
cending branch of ridges) transport of warm and cold air15. This
alignment of the planetary waves causes large temperature
gradients in different secto

The intensity of Indian summer monsoon rainfall (ISMR) over Central India (CI) is known to be positively correlated with the dust
aerosol loading over the Arabian Sea (AS) on short time scales of about a week. However, global oscillations such as the El-Nino
Southern Oscillation (ENSO) modulate both the rainfall over India and aerosol loading over the AS. This study uses long-term
satellite-based aerosol and gridded rainfall datasets to explore the correlation between AS aerosol and CI rainfall and their
relationship to ENSO. It is found that the highest correlation is during El-Nino (0.53), followed by Normal (0.44) and La-Nina (0.34)
years, closely following the overall dust aerosol loading over the AS. Spatially, irrespective of the phase of ENSO, the high aerosol
loading conditions are associated with increased winds over the AS, shifting eastward towards the Indian mainland and enhancing
rainfall over CI and elsewhere across the Indian landmass. In contrast, the low aerosol loading conditions over the AS are associated
with reduced winds, shifting westward away from the Indian mainland, suppressing rainfall over CI. In response to anthropogenic
climate change, the El-Nino-like conditions are likely to increase in the future, making the dust aerosol-induced monsoon rainfall
enhancement/modulation significant.","INTRODUCTION
The atmospheric aerosols can modulate Earth’s climate directly by
scattering and absorbing the incoming solar and outgoing
terrestrial longwave radiation1–3 and indirectly by acting as cloud
condensation nuclei and ice nuclei, thereby modifying the overall
cloud properties4–6. Aerosols impact the local, regional and global
climate at different temporal and spatial scales through these
effects. They also modulate the Indian summer monsoon rainfall
(ISMR) through multiple pathways7–13. For example, solar dimming
induced by anthropogenic aerosols over the northern hemisphere
slows down monsoon circulation by altering the north-south
surface temperature gradient, reducing rainfall over the Indian
region14. This mechanism has been responsible for changes in
monsoon rainfall since the second half of the 20th century. On the
other hand, the atmospheric absorption by aerosols such as dust
and black carbon during the pre-monsoon season enhances early
monsoon rainfall by the elevated heat pump hypothesis (EHP)15,16.
The physical mechanism underlying the delayed response in
monsoon rainfall to pre-monsoon aerosol loading through EHP
still eludes the scientific community17–20. Against this backdrop, a
study showed that remote aerosols over West Asia/North Africa
and the Arabian Sea(AS) modulate monsoon rainfall on short time
scales of about a week21. The hypothesis states that the dust
aerosols accumulated over the AS cause atmospheric warming to
strengthen
the
monsoon
circulation,
leading
to
increased
monsoon rainfall over Central India (CI) in about a week. Following
this, few other studies using extensive satellite-based measure-
ments and simulations conducted by global and regional climate
models supported these findings and suggested similar hypoth-
eses and a few different variants22–24. In addition, in the future
warming scenarios, studies have indicated that the positive
correlation between dust loading over the AS and rainfall over
India may likely strengthen due to the increased wind speed over
the
dust-source
regions
leading
to
increased
transport
of
aerosols25. Thus, the Indian monsoon rainfall is modulated by
remote dust feedback to a certain extent.
The ENSO significantly impacts both the ISMR and dust loading
over the AS. The El-Nino years are associated with deficit rainfall,
and most of the La-Nina years are associated with surplus rainfall
over India during the monsoon period26,27. Studies have also
shown that the changes in the circulation patterns and rain
associated with ENSO affect the emission and transport of dust
aerosols from nearby dust-source regions to AS28,29. Therefore,
changes in ENSO phases may alter the strength of the AS dust-
monsoon relationship with implications to monsoon rainfall.
Some studies have explored the effect of ENSO in modulating
the EHP mechanism over the Tibetan Plateau30,31. However, no
observational studies have examined the relationship between
Arabian Sea aerosols and Indian monsoon rainfall and its
sensitivity to ENSO. Also, recent studies have indicated that El-
Nino-like conditions will increase in the future due to anthro-
pogenic climate change32,33. Therefore, it is essential to under-
stand how ENSO may modulate the relationship between AS dust
aerosol and monsoon rainfall. Thus the primary objective of this
study is to explore how different phases of ENSO modulate the
strength
of
the
correlation
between
AS
aerosols
and

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The correlation between the AS aerosols and CI rainfall
A study first reported the short-term correlation between aerosol
loading over the AS and monsoon rainfall over CI21. They used 10
years of daily/weekly mean aerosol and rainfall datasets to reveal
this relationship. In this paper, the first step is to identify whether

The Tibetan Plateau (TP) is known as one of the most sensitive regions to climate change, and it has experienced accelerated
warming in recent decades. However, to what degree the TP warming amplification relates to remote forcing such as sea ice loss in
the Arctic sea ice remains unclear. Here, we found that the decline of sea ice concentration over the Barents-Kara Sea (BKS) could
account for 18–32% of the winter warming over the TP by comparing observational data and ensemble experiments from an
atmospheric general circulation model. The reduced BKS sea ice and resultant upward turbulent heat fluxes can intensify a Rossby
wave train propagating equatorward to the TP. As a result, the enhanced southwesterlies towards the TP strengthen the warm
advection over most parts of the TP and lead to TP warming. In addition, an atmospheric teleconnection between the Arctic and
the TP also exists in the interannual variability. That is, a tripole mode in air temperature, with warm centers in the Arctic and TP but
a cold center in the mid-high latitudes of the Eurasian continent in between. Our results imply that the BKS sea ice loss could
intensify such a tripole mode and thus enhancing the winter TP warming.","INTRODUCTION
The Tibetan Plateau (TP, often called the third pole) covers an area
of about 2.5 million square kilometers with an average altitude of
over 4000 m1. It holds thousands of glaciers and is the source of
many Asian rivers such as the Yellow River and Yangtze River2,3.
Serving as the water tower of Asia4,5, the rivers originating from
the TP provide water for about 40% of the world’s population. The
unique topography of the TP exerts a significant influence on the
Asian monsoon and even the global climate through the dynamic
and thermal effects6–9. In the context of global warming, the
annual warming rate in the TP is 0.34 °C/decade during 1979–2020
based on the ERA5 reanalysis10, which is faster than the global
average and second only to the Arctic among all regions in the
world10–12. The observed warming trend exists in all seasons but
the strongest warming occurs in winter, followed by autumn10–12.
As a result, the frequency and intensity of extreme weather and
climate events in the TP have increased significantly13, and the
glaciers have melted intensively3,14. The reasons behind the
enhanced TP warming are complex, and some mechanisms have
been proposed, including the increase of greenhouse gas
emissions9,15 and atmospheric water vapor16,17, snow and ice
albedo feedback17,18, the weakened winter monsoon19, increased
lower clouds20,21 and brown clouds22,23, and the land use24,25.
However, it is not yet clear which process is dominant.
Meanwhile, owing to the unique environmental characteristics
and rich natural resources, the Arctic has attracted much attention
from scientists and governments worldwide26–28. The climate in
the Arctic has undergone unprecedented changes. Particularly,
the near-surface temperature of the Arctic has risen at a rate more
than twice the global average29 and even more than four times in
winter during the recent decades. This phenomenon is known as
the Arctic amplification (AA), which has unneglectable regional
and global influences30,31. The mechanisms responsible for the AA
have been widely discussed32–37, and some studies36,37 indicate
that the Arctic sea ice loss38,39 plays an important contribution.
So far, however, there have been no reports connecting the TP
warming with the rapid change in the Arctic sea ice to our
knowledge. It is suggested that the reduction of the Arctic sea ice
can intensify aerosol transport to the TP40, increase the frequency
of Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall extremes41 and heatwaves in
southwestern China42, and deepen the East Asian Trough in late
winter43. This study aims to detect the possible contribution of the
sea ice loss in the Arctic to the TP winter warming quantitatively
by data analysis and numerical experiments from an atmospheric
general circulation model (AGCM).

temperature (SAT) during 1979–2018 presented by the ERA5
reanalysis can reach above 2 °C/decade in the northeastern BKS.
Meanwhile, a significant warming trend also exists in the TP. Along
with the dramatic Arctic warming, the sea ice concentration (SIC)
in the northeastern BKS has declined rapidly by more than 20%
per decade (Fig. 1b). A numerical sensitivity experiment with
prescribed observed SIC and surface sea temperature (SST) in the
BKS
(named
as

Methods)
demonstrates that the SIC change in BKS could enhance the
winter TP warming. Note that the warming magnitude in the
Arctic derived from the BKS experiment is similar to the ERA5
(Fig. 1c). Moreover, the decrease of BKS SIC induces a significant
cooling trend in the mid-high latitudes of the Eurasia continent

Mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions is crucial for achieving the goals of the Paris climate agreement. One key gas is methane,
whose representation in most climate models is limited by using prescribed surface concentrations. Here we use a new, methane
emissions-driven version of the UK Earth System Model (UKESM1) and simulate a zero anthropogenic methane emissions scenario
(ZAME) in order to (i) attribute the role of anthropogenic methane emissions on the Earth system and (ii) bracket the potential for
theoretical maximum mitigation. We find profound, rapid and sustained impacts on atmospheric composition and climate,
compared to a counterfactual projection (SSP3-7.0, the ’worst case’ scenario for methane). In ZAME, methane declines to below pre-
industrial levels within 12 years and global surface ozone decreases to levels seen in the 1970s. By 2050, 690,000 premature deaths
per year and 1° of warming can be attributed to anthropogenic methane in SSP3-7.0. This work demonstrates the significant
maximum potential of methane emissions reductions, and their air-quality co-benefits, but also reiterates the need for action on
carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. We show that a methane emissions-driven treatment is essential for simulating the full Earth
system impacts and feedbacks of methane emissions changes.","INTRODUCTION
In order to achieve the Paris agreement goals1, many countries are
committing to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to net-
zero by 2050 (see Carbon dioxide
(CO2) mitigation is fundamental to minimise long-term tempera-
ture increase, and the peak global warming is proportional to the
cumulative CO2 emissions. Near-term climate forcers (NTCFs)
including methane, ozone (O3) and aerosols, have much shorter
lifetimes than CO2, and provide opportunities for short-term
mitigation. Unlike for CO2, their climate forcing is determined by
the rate of emissions2.
Methane (CH4) is a potent GHG but has a short lifetime
compared with CO2 (9.1 ± 0.9 years, total atmospheric lifetime3),
mainly due to its reaction with the hydroxyl radical (OH). Since
pre-industrial times, anthropogenic methane emissions have
caused more than a doubling of the abundance of methane in
the atmosphere, with rapid growth in recent years4, and especially
in 2020 (gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends_ch4/). These emissions now
make up 60% of the total methane source and come from fossil
fuel use, agriculture and waste management5.
The role of methane as a lever to achieve climate goals is an
active topic6–9. Over 100 countries (representing 50% of anthro-
pogenic methane emissions) recently signed up to the Global
Methane Pledge (globalmethanepledge.org), and there is exten-
sive potential for mitigation8,10,11. This includes reduction of hot-
spot emissions (such as gas leakage and waste management, e.g.
Höglund-Isaksson et al.12) and direct air capture13,14. Ocko et al.7
found that a quarter of a degree of warming could be avoided by
2050 by implementing currently available methane mitigation
technologies. This paper assesses the impacts of methane
emissions on the Earth system by exploring a zero anthropogenic
methane emissions scenario (ZAME).
Previous studies (e.g. refs.
8,15–18) have highlighted the
significant co-benefits of methane mitigation for climate on
global air quality, principally through tropospheric ozone.
Recently, Allen et al.17 used Shared Socioeconomic Pathway
(SSP) experiments from the Aerosol and Chemistry Model
Intercomparison Project (AerChemMIP) to isolate the methane-
only contribution of NTCF mitigation from a high methane
scenario (SSP3-7.0) level down to SSP1-2.6 levels. In this study,
they show that by 2050, the global mean atmospheric methane
concentration decreases by 26%, resulting in a 9.7% decrease in
surface ozone concentrations, and a temperature decrease of
0.39 ± 0.05 K, compared to SSP3-7.0. Shindell et al.8 explored a
methane concentration reduction of 30% compared to the
present
day
(2015)
using
an
ensemble
of
models.
They
attributed
a
global
population-weighted
ozone
exposure
decrease of 2–2.5 ppb, and a temperature decrease of 0.18 ±
0.02 K to the methane change.
Whilst simpler climate models (e.g. Hayman et al.19) can be used
to rapidly assess the surface temperature effects of different
emissions scenarios, their interactive modelling of methane
processes, particularly the effects of methane on tropospheric
oxidising capacity, are limited. On the other hand, general
circulation models (GCMs) and Earth system models (ESMs) are
able to represent the atmospheric processes involving methane
more fully. Traditionally, these complex models use a methane
lower boundary condition (LBC): a global time-varying methane
surface concentration pre-calculated from emissions. This leads to
a buffering effect at the surface, which limits the feedback of
atmospheric oxidation on methane levels20. The new emissions-
driven configuration of the UK Chemistry and Aerosol model
(UKCA), coupled to UKESM1.0 (hereafter referred to as UKCA-
CH421, (GAF, ZS, ATA, PTG, FOC et al. 2022, submitted for
publication) allows us to bridge the benefits of these two

The rainy season over southern China (SC) begins with the onset of the South China Sea monsoon around mid-May. We
demonstrate here that the SC precipitation exhibits a notable drying (wetting) trend prior to (after) the monsoon onset, leading to a
more abrupt thus amplified hydrological transition over SC in early summer. The contrasting precipitation trends are largely driven
by the recent decline in mid-latitude synoptic eddy activity. Weakened mid-latitude synoptic disturbances suppress SC frontal
activities before the monsoon onset, facilitating the drying trend, and enhance the spatial stationarity of the SC monsoonal front
after the monsoon onset, leading to the wetting trend. CMIP6 models in general fail to capture the contrasting trends between the
two periods. In models where both the trends in precipitation and mid-latitude synoptic eddy activity are well captured, the
amplification of the hydrological transition over SC is projected to continue well into the late 21st century. Our results highlight the
footprints of hemispheric-scale climate change in regional hydroclimate and the obvious challenges faced by climate models in
capturing such footprints.","INTRODUCTION
Global subtropical precipitation undergoes an observed and
projected decline under global warming1,2, with considerable
regional and temporal variability3,4. The East Asian summer
monsoon region is projected to have enhanced precipitation
and more extreme events in the late 21st century5. Therefore,
southern China, which includes a subtropical coastline in the East
Asian monsoon region, features large variability of precipitation
and is vulnerable to global warming. How the precipitation over
southern China varies with climate change is an important
socioeconomic issue, because southern China holds about 2/3 of
the population of China, and urbanized regions such as the Pearl
River Delta have been expanding in southern China as a fast-
growing economic center and high-tech hub. The infrastructure
inside this metropolitan area is vulnerable to high-impact weather
events such as heavy precipitation and drought6. Policy makers
and investors should be better prepared for the potential risks due
to the future precipitation trend under global warming.
The rainy season in southern China ranges from April to
September, the first half of which is called the pre-rainy season,
i.e., April to June7,8. The diabatic heating produced by such an
intense rainy season is a major part of the East Asian summer
monsoon heating, which affects the structure and strength of the
subtropical high over the Pacific and tends to force a stationary
wave pattern of global influence, for instance on the American-
Atlantic regions9–13. Around mid-May, the onset of the South
China Sea summer monsoon (SCSSM) marks the commencement
of the monsoonal rainy season14–16. After the SCSSM onset,
precipitation over southern China increases more than 40% as
compared to that before the monsoon onset16. The precipitation
of the pre-rainy season is classified into cold frontal precipitation
and summer monsoonal precipitation with respect to the SCSSM
onset15,16. The first type of precipitation is linked to cold fronts,
which are closely associated with synoptic disturbances in the
mid-latitudes17,18. The second type is associated with convective
instability and quasi-stationary fronts, which are the slow-moving
and long-lasting East Asian summer monsoon systems, with large
spatial coverage over land and ocean15. Variation in the quasi-
stationary fronts is modulated mainly by the western North Pacific
subtropical high, tropical sea surface temperature (SST), westerly
jet streams, and atmospheric eddies from the mid-latitudes17–20.
Both tropical and mid-latitude forcings are thus crucial for the pre-
rainy season precipitation over southern China. In this study, the
pre-rainy season is divided into two periods, the pre-monsoon
onset (pre-MO) and post-monsoon onset (post-MO), with respect
to the SCSSM onset due to the different forcings involving
precipitation.
While the SCSSM has tended to commence earlier and has
intensified since the early 1990s, the summer precipitation over
southern China experienced a prominent decadal strengthening
in the mid-1990s21–25. Besides the summer decadal trend, Zhu
et al.26 found an out-of-phase decadal shift in the spring and
summer precipitation over southern China from 1979–1992 to
1997–2010, with drier springs and wetter summers in the latter
period. They proposed that a springtime La Niña-like decadal SST
anomaly pattern in the tropical Pacific could trigger more
convection over the Maritime Continent and cause anomalous
descending motion over southern China, while summertime
decadal warming over the Indian Ocean could inhibit convection
over the Maritime Continent and strengthen the monsoon trough

Atmospheric rivers (ARs) impacting western North America are analyzed under climate intervention applying stratospheric aerosol
injections (SAI) using simulations produced by the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model. Sulfur dioxide injections are
strategically placed to maintain present-day global, interhemispheric, and equator-to-pole surface temperatures between 2020 and
2100 using a high forcing climate scenario. Three science questions are addressed: (1) How will western North American ARs
change by the end of the century with SAI applied, (2) How is this different from 2020 conditions, and (3) How will the results differ
with no future climate intervention. Under SAI, ARs are projected to increase by the end of the 21st century for southern California
and decrease in the Pacific Northwest and coastal British Columbia, following changes to the low-level wind. Compared to 2020
conditions, the increase in ARs is not significant. The character of AR precipitation changes under geoengineering results in fewer
extreme rainfall events and more moderate ones.","INTRODUCTION
Atmospheric rivers (ARs) play a crucial role in Earth’s hydrological
cycle by transporting moisture via long, narrow, synoptic-scale
weather features often associated with extratropical cyclones1.
Coastlines along the westernmost portions continents, and in
particular,
western
North
America,
are
disproportionately
impacted by ARs compared to interior continental areas because
much of the moisture, either remotely or locally sourced, begins
to dry as the storm system moves inland2–4. For western North
America, AR moisture is primarily forced upward through
orographic lift as the AR collides with the mountain ranges, such
Sierra
Nevada
and
Cascades,
thus
providing
the
physical
mechanism to produce significant precipitation5–7. Regions such
as California receive over half of their annual precipitation
through
ARs8,9,
with
precipitation
ranging
from
beneficial,
drought-relieving rain to destructive events that initiate extreme
flooding10–13. As the climate continues to warm, ARs are expected
to grow in size and contain a higher moisture content, potentially
worsening floods and increasing extreme events2,14–17. Under-
standing how ARs change in the future is critical for managing
water resources in local communities.
Solar geoengineering, in particular stratospheric aerosol injection
(SAI), has been debated as a possible intervention method to
reduce some of the worst effects of global warming. In recent years,
it has become clear that reaching important climate targets will be
increasingly difficult due to the continued use of fossil fuels and
subsequent increase in greenhouse gas emissions. Scientific debate
on the wisdom of climate intervention strategies has populated the
scientific literature for over a decade18–21. SAI has been proposed to
have the potential to mitigate the effects of climate change until
greenhouse gas
concentrations can
be sufficiently
reduced.
However, large uncertainties still exist in our understanding of the
impacts of these methods. Do the risks and dangers of engineering
a solution to combat serious climate change impacts outweigh the
benefits of such an exercise? To answer this question, first, we must
fully understand the consequences of different climate intervention
strategies. The recent National Academies of Sciences, Engineering
and Medicine (NASEM) report on solar geoengineering research
and governance22 concluded that studies done to date do not
provide a sufficient basis for supporting informed decisions and
recommends research to better characterize and reduce uncertain-
ties concerning benefits and risk of solar geoengineering deploy-
ment. One set of tools at our disposal are Earth System Models
(ESMs) as evidenced by the GeoMIP (Geoengineering Model
Intercomparison Project) effort, where different modeling centers
around the world applied the same climate engineering scenarios
to their ESMs in order to assess climate projections23. Due to the
participation of varying ESM-complexity, some GeoMIP experiments
have been simplified and utilized solar constant reduction or a
prescribed aerosol distribution24,25. In addition, even the more
complex experiments performed stratospheric injections at the
equator which have led to overcooling of the tropics and
undercooling of the poles26. Kravitz et al.27 presented the first
simulation of solar geoengineering using multiple locations of
sulfur dioxide (SO2) injections (15°S, 15°N, 30°S, 30°N), with the
amount of SO2 varying from year to year to meet three
simultaneous temperature objectives. This approach significantly
reduced the overcooling/undercooling patterns noted in previous
studies as global mean temperature, the pole-to-pole temperature

The tropical western Pacific (TWP) has profound influences on climate. ENSO is an important source of interannual variability of TWP
SST, but extratropical precursors are far less known. Here we show a significant interhemispheric influence from subtropical
Southwest Pacific (SWP) on the TWP. Observational analysis suggests that SWP SST in boreal spring has strong coherence with TWP
6 months later. The spring SWP warming signal exhibits a unique interhemispheric propagation embedded in the southerly cross-
equatorial flow over the western Pacific. The wind-evaporation-SST feedback initiates and maintains the progression of warm SST
anomalies toward the TWP in autumn. The climate model successfully reproduces such an interhemispheric SST propagation. The
seasonal evolution of SST variability improves the predictability of the warm pool SST by about 6 months. An SWP SST-based
prediction model shows considerable hindcast skill (r = 0.80, p < 0.01), indicating that it is a valuable precursor of the TWP.","INTRODUCTION
The tropical western Pacific (TWP), where the world’s largest warm
pool is located, is characterized by the warmest sea waters among
the tropical oceans, with the annual sea surface temperature (SST)
exceeding 28 °C1. The TWP has dramatic impacts on the world’s
weather and climate2–4. The TWP is an essential source of kinetic
energy and water vapor5,6, driving large-scale
atmospheric
circulations and affecting precipitations locally and remotely7,8.
Considering the large heat content and high SST in the TWP, it can
easily trigger strong and deep convections. Consequently, it heats
the upper-level troposphere9 and transports water masses and
energies toward the eastern Pacific and higher latitudes through
both the Walker and Hadley circulations5,10. In addition to the
local convective precipitation, the TWP can affect the monsoonal
rainfall in East Asia via atmospheric teleconnection11,12. It also
profoundly influences the numbers, genesis frequency, and tracks
of tropical cyclones in the western North Pacific13–15. A previous
study suggested that the size and intensity of the warm pool have
undergone significant increases under the human-caused global
warming16. It is almost certain that the impacts of the TWP on the
global climate will increase substantially in the future. Therefore, it
is of importance to understand the driving mechanisms and
improve the prediction skills of the TWP SST variability by
searching useful precursors.
The TWP is influenced by the convergence of tropical ocean
currents driven by trade winds, local air-sea feedbacks (e.g., cirrus
cloud; evaporation; convection), and large-scale atmospheric
circulations17–19. The TWP warm SST episodes occur with a
preference for spring and fall7 when the maximum solar
radiation reaches the tropics20. The seasonal variations of the
TWP SST also result from the net surface heat fluxes associated
with trade and monsoonal winds and horizontal/vertical oceanic
advection21. On the interannual time scale, the TWP is an
essential counterpart of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
cycle. The migration of the warm pool (including centroid, east
edge, and size) associated with surface winds and zonal oceanic
advection is in phase with the ENSO variation22,23. In addition,
heat content in the TWP also influences the intensity of the
following ENSO24. Previous studies have demonstrated that the
TWP SST and ENSO are closely correlated when ENSO leads by
5 months and the coverage of the warm pool expands eastward
after
the
preceding
ENSO20.
Moreover,
the
ENSO-induced
westward propagation of Rossby waves can influence the TWP
SST variation and deep convection activities25. As suggested in
the previous study, the close relationship between the TWP and
ENSO enriched our understanding
of
the
tropical
ocean-
atmosphere interactions and using the TWP as a precursor
greatly improved the prediction skills of ENSO22. However, as
most previous and current studies focus on the eastern Pacific
SST variability predictions, the model performances in reprodu-
cing and predicting the TWP SST variability are far from skillful26.
There is an urgent need to improve the predictability of the
warm pool considering its dramatic impacts on the climate
system, but finding useful precursors still remains an unresolved
issue in the current literature.
Recent studies have highlighted a significant leading influence
of extratropical variability on the tropical climate through air-sea
interactions, particularly over the Northeast Pacific27–30. The
propagations of extratropical SST anomalies to the tropics have
been found in both hemispheres associated with the North/South
Pacific meridional mode (NPMM/SPMM)31,32, which has great
implications for extending the predictability of the tropical
eastern/central Pacific SSTs in terms of the time lags during the
evolution33,34. In contrast, it is lesser-known in the literature
whether there exist precursors or remote connections to the TWP

The Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO) is the dominant mode of intraseasonal variability in the tropics and has a documented
influence on extratropical extreme weather through modulation of synoptic atmospheric conditions. MJO phase has been
correlated with anomalous tornado and severe hail frequency in the United States (US). However, the robustness of this relationship
is unsettled, and the variability of physical pathways to modulation is poorly understood, despite the socioeconomic impacts that
tornadoes and hail evoke. We approached this problem using pentad MJO indices and practically perfect severe weather hindcasts.
MJO lifecycles were cataloged and clustered to document variability and potential pathways to enhanced subseasonal tornado and
hail predictability. Statistically significant increases in US tornado and hail probabilities were documented 3–4 weeks following the
period of the strongest upper-level divergence for the 53 active MJO events that propagated past the Maritime continent,
contrasting with the 47 MJO events that experienced the barrier effect, during boreal spring 1979–2019. The 53 MJO events that
propagated past the Maritime continent revealed three prevailing MJO evolutions—each containing unique pathways and
modulation of US tornado and hail frequency—advancing our knowledge and capability to anticipate these hazards at extended
lead times.","INTRODUCTION
The Madden–Julian Oscillation1 (MJO) has recently been exploited
as a source of skillful subseasonal predictability for United States
(US) severe convective storms (SCSs; tornadoes, severe hail, and
damaging convective wind gusts)2–4. SCSs are a perennial source
of insured losses totaling $10B annually5 in the US, and their
extended-range prediction remains an area of significant stake-
holder interest6. The MJO is characterized as a meso-α cluster of
deep convection in the Indian Ocean that migrates eastward into
the Indo-Pacific warm pool with a timescale between 30 and
90 days7,8. Diabatic latent heating associated with extensive MJO
convection can generate Rossby waves9–14, as the divergent
tropopause-level flow advects potential vorticity poleward and
interacts with mid-latitude westerly jets15–17. MJO-induced wave
trains often propagate poleward and eastward toward North
America, altering the atmospheric circulation and associated
probability and frequency of extreme temperatures and precipita-
tion18–23, atmospheric rivers24,25, snowstorms26,27, hurricanes28,29,
and SCSs30–33. In short, increasing our understanding of the MJO’s
influence and variability on extratropical extreme weather is vital
to enhancing skillful subseasonal forecasts34.
The MJO can be objectively characterized using a myriad of
instantaneous or time-filtered tropical kinematic and thermody-
namic quantities. The Real-time Multivariate MJO35 (RMM) index
uses meridional averages of outgoing longwave radiation (OLR)—
along with 850-hPa and 200-hPa tropical zonal winds—to classify
the MJO into one of eight phases and determine relative strength.
The OLR-based MJO index36 (OMI) aims to capture deep
convection,
derived
by
projecting
20–96
day
filtered
OLR
anomalies onto the two leading spatial EOF patterns. Previous
studies investigated the relationships between these MJO indices
and US tornado and hail occurrence. For example, April tornado
days were more likely during MJO RMM phases 6 and 8, whereas
May tornado days were more likely during MJO RMM phases 5 and
830. Violent tornado outbreaks in the boreal spring were more
than twice as likely during MJO RMM phase 231. A comprehensive
analysis examining OMI and RMM noted enhanced frequency of
tornado days during phase 2 of the RMM, whereas OMI produced
non-statistically significant results, highlighting the sensitivity of
methods37. Strong instantaneous correlations between days with
anomalous hail frequency and RMM MJO phase have also been
noted32.
In addition, the MJO has recently been leveraged to highlight
potential SCS “forecasts of opportunity”2,3. Specifically, a statisti-
cally significant increase in central Great Plains tornado and hail
frequency was evident 3–4 weeks following MJO OMI phase 8 and
several weeks following phases 1 and 22. A research team used
the MJO in a pseudo-operational setting during April–May 2019 to
anticipate an above-average tornado-frequency period 3–4 weeks
in advance, which verified with tornado counts more than triple
the expected 30-year average4. The onset of the significant MJO
event was immediately followed by a period of above-average
Earth-relative atmospheric angular momentum (AAM), subsequent
breakdown of a strong zonally oriented north-Pacific jet stream,
retrogression of the Rossby wave pattern over the conterminous
US, and a favorable synoptic-scale atmospheric regime for
SCSs3,38.
Many studies examined the concurrent relationship between
MJO phase and SCS frequency, but have omitted physical
characteristics (e.g., strength, propagation speed) of individual
MJO events that may have varied time-lagged responses. Here, we
examine the MJO–SCS connection in the context of MJO lifecycle
components and show significant modulations of tornado and
hail probabilities following the period of the strongest MJO upper-
level divergence. We show distinct pathways to SCS environment
and event modulation that are dependent on MJO flavor (i.e.,

Inorganic nitrate production is critical in atmospheric chemistry that reflects the oxidation capacity and the acidity of the
atmosphere. Here we use the oxygen anomaly of nitrate (Δ17O(NO
3 )) in high-time-resolved (3 h) aerosols to explore the chemical
mechanisms of nitrate evolution in fine particles during the winter in Nanjing, a megacity of China. The continuous Δ17O(NO
3 )
observation suggested the dominance of nocturnal chemistry (NO3 + HC/H2O and N2O5 + H2O/Cl−) in nitrate formation in the
wintertime. Significant diurnal variations of nitrate formation pathways were found. The contribution of nocturnal chemistry
increased at night and peaked (72%) at midnight. Particularly, nocturnal pathways became more important for the formation of
nitrate in the process of air pollution aggravation. In contrast, the contribution of daytime chemistry (NO2 + OH/H2O) increased
with the sunrise and showed a highest fraction (48%) around noon. The hydrolysis of N2O5 on particle surfaces played an important
role in the daytime nitrate production on haze days. In addition, the reaction of NO2 with OH radicals was found to dominate the
nitrate production after nitrate chemistry was reset by the precipitation events. These results suggest the importance of high-time-
resolved observations of Δ17O(NO
3 ) for exploring dynamic variations in reactive nitrogen chemistry.","INTRODUCTION
Nitrate (NO
3 ) and its precursor NOx (NOx = NO + NO2) play a
crucial role in atmospheric chemical processes and the formation
of PM2.5, fine particles with diameter less than 2.5 μm1,2. Tropo-
spheric NOx oxidation drives the formation of ozone (O3) and
recycle of hydroxyl radicals (OH) that control the atmospheric self-
cleansing capacity3. Majority of NOx emitted from various sources
are finally converted into nitric acid (HNO3) and organic nitrate
(e.g.,
RONO2)
through
atmospheric
oxidation
processes
by
oxidants (e.g., O3, OH, HO2, and RO2)4. HNO3 lowers the pH of
the precipitation and increases the risk of forming acid rain5.
Furthermore, HNO3 easily be transformed into nitrate particles
through atmospheric reactions with alkaline ammonia that in turn
influence the chemical composition and the size of existing
particles, affecting the formation of clouds and precipitation as
well3,6. RONO2 can partition into the particle phase (RONO2(p)) and
then is removed from the atmosphere by deposition to the
surface or through hydrolysis to form inorganic nitrate and
alcohols7,8. Atmospheric nitrate in gas phase (HNO3(g)), liquid
phase (HNO3(aq)) and particulates (NO
3 (p)) are eventually removed
through wet/dry deposition. Thus investigating the mechanism of
NOx-NO
3 conversion is important to the study of atmospheric
chemistry.
The conversion of NOx to NO
3 is a combination of the NOx
cycle (Supplementary Note 1) and nitrate production processes.
During the day, OH radical is easily generated under the strong
sunlight and HNO3(g) is then formed through the NO2 + OH
reaction9. NO2 can be hydrolyzed on surfaces to produce
HNO3(aq)10, which was found to be a weak source of nitrate
formation on severe haze days in winter in the North China Plain
(NCP)11,12. In addition, NO2 can also react with O3 to form NO3
radicals and then NO3 directly reacts with hydrocarbon (HC) and
dimethylsulfide (DMS) or be hydrolyzed on surfaces to produce
HNO313–15. This reaction occurred at night because NO3 radical is
easily photolyzed to NO2 under sunlight16. And the contribution of
NO3 + DMS is small in non-coastal areas due to the low mixing
ratio of DMS17. Dinitrogen pentoxide (N2O5), a nocturnal NOx
reservoir, can react on airborne particle surface to produce only
HNO3(aq) or both NO
3 (p) and nitryl chloride (ClNO2)18. Other
potential formation mechanisms of nitrate particles, like the
hydrolysis of organic nitrates (RONO2) and halogen nitrates
(XNO3), might be important in coastal regions or the rainforest
areas like Amazonia13.

In the backdrop of overwhelming evidences of associations between North-Atlantic (NA) sea-surface temperature (SST) and the
Indian summer Monsoon Rainfall (ISMR), the lack of a quantitative nonlinear causal inference has been a roadblock for advancing
ISMR predictability. Here, we advance a hypothesis of teleconnection between the NA-SST and ISMR, and establish the causality
between the two using two different nonlinear causal inference techniques. We unravel that the NA-SST and the El Nino and
Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are two independent drivers of ISMR with the former contributing as much to ISMR variability as does
the latter. Observations and climate model simulations support the NA-SST–ISMR causality through a Rossby wave-train driven by
NA-SST that modulates the seasonal mean by forcing long active (break) spells of ISMR.","INTRODUCTION
With the country’s food production and economy depending on
it1,2, the Indian summer monsoon rainfall (ISMR) is the lifeline of
one-fifth of the world’s population living in the region. It is not
surprising, therefore, that developing a model for forewarning of
ISMR one season in advance has a history of more than a century
in India led by the pioneering work of Blanford3. Despite great
advances in ocean-atmosphere observation, computing resources,
development of improved empirical4,5 and coupled climate
models for ISMR prediction, the prediction of ISMR remains a
grand challenge problem in climate science6. Although many
different predictors have been identified for predicting ISMR since
then7, the El Nino and Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has remained
the leading predictable driver of ISMR, even though the relation-
ship between ISMR and an ENSO index shows a weakening trend
in recent decades (Supplementary Fig. 1b8) with a tendency for
recovery to higher negative correlations in more recent years.
With
ISMR
defined
from
another
dataset9,
however,
the
ENSO–ISMR correlation continues to decrease in recent years.
Further, the maximum negative correlation between ISMR and
Nino3.4 SST takes place 3–4 months after the peak of ISMR
(Supplementary Fig. 1c), suggesting a potential role of ISMR in
driving the ENSO. In fact the lead–lag relationship (Supplementary
Fig. 1c) indicates that the ISMR could feedback and influence the
ENSO10 making the ENSO–ISMR relationship tangled11,12 and
potentially a bi-directional causality. It is also notable that the
ENSO–ISMR relationship undergoes a multi-decadal variation
(Supplementary Fig. 1b13) implying that there are periods when
ENSO could explain up to 35% of inter-annual variability of ISMR
while there are periods when it could explain less than 10% of
ISMR variability. Further, it is noted that a nearly equal number of
floods and droughts occur without a La Nina or an El Nino
(Supplementary Fig. 1a), indicating the role of non-ENSO drivers
on observed inter-annual variability of ISMR.
A recent study14 argues that the traditional “signal-to-noise”
estimates of “potential skill” or limit of potential predictability are
underestimated and a model-based estimate of “potential skill”
indicates that it could be much higher than previously thought
explaining up to 70% of inter-annual variability of ISMR, far
beyond that could be explained by association with the ENSO.
Some additional sources of ISMR predictability come from other
slowly varying potential drivers like the Eurasian snow cover15–18,
Pacific
Decadal
Oscillation
(PDO)19,20,
Indian
Ocean
Dipole
Mode21–23, the Atlantic Nino24–27 and Atlantic tripole28, have
been explored recently. However, the physical mechanisms
through which they influence the ISMR, the robustness of the
relationships, and the fraction of ISMR variability explained by
them are still being debated. As a result, the causality and the
direction of causality between these potential drivers and ISMR
are neither well established nor their independence from the
ENSO and the North-Atlantic sea-surface temperature (SST)
variability is established.
In addition to the ENSO, there is considerable evidence that cold
NA SSTs are associated with mega-droughts of Indian monsoon in
the past29,30. In recent years, the NA SST is also linked with ISMR on
multi-decadal time-scales28,31–35. While the North-Atlantic multi-
decadal variability (alternately also known as the Atlantic multi-
decadal oscillation, AMO) could be modified by either natural or
anthropogenic aerosols36–39, ocean-atmosphere feedback is critical
for the basic multi-decadal variability in the Atlantic33,40,41. With
considerable evidence of decadal predictability of the North-
Atlantic climate and the AMO42–45, it represents an extra-tropical
predictable driver for ISMR. In addition, the Southern Annular
Mode (SAM) also has a notable association with the ISMR
variability46–49. While the SAM is a manifestatio

Aerosol-boundary layer interactions play an important role in affecting atmospheric thermodynamics and air pollution. As a key
factor in dictating the development of the boundary layer, the entrainment process in the context of aerosol-boundary layer
interactions is still poorly understood. Using comprehensive field observations made at a superstation in Beijing, we gain insight
into the response of the entrainment process to aerosols. We found that high aerosol loading can significantly suppress the
entrainment rate, breaking the conventional linear relationship between sensible heat fluxes and entrainment fluxes. Related to
aerosol vertical distributions, aerosol heating effects can alter vertical heat fluxes, leading to a strong interaction between aerosols
and the entrainment process in the upper boundary layer. Such aerosol-entrainment coupling can inhibit boundary layer
development and explains the great sensitivity of observed entrainment rates to aerosols than can traditional calculations. The
notable impact of aerosols on the entrainment process raises holistic thinking about the dynamic framework of the boundary layer
in a polluted atmosphere, which may have a significant bearing on the dispersion of air pollutants and the land-atmosphere
coupling.","INTRODUCTION
Aerosols exert critical influences on the climate system through
direct and indirect radiative forcing. Although great progress has
been made during the past decades in understanding the
important effects of aerosols on climate, they are still among
the largest uncertainties in understanding and projecting climate
changes1–5. It is challenging to accurately quantify the aerosol
impacts on the climate system because of insufficient under-
standing of the integrated aerosol radiative effects and drastic
variations of aerosols in both temporal and spatial scales6–10.
Aerosols interact with the planetary boundary layer (PBL)
through aerosol radiative forcing4,11,12. Aerosol-PBL interactions
(API) are reported as one of the key mechanisms in the formation
of severe air pollution5,13,14. In particular, aerosols are known to
inhibit the development of the PBL by regulating surface sensible
heat (SH)15–18. A shallow PBL would, in turn, favor the accumula-
tion of aerosols, leading to the well-recognized positive feedback
in the API11,13,19,20. However, the PBL entrainment, a process
representing the turbulent exchange of air masses and heat fluxes
between the PBL and the free atmosphere21,22, has not been well
understood in the context of API. Because turbulent fluxes within
the PBL cannot be solved mathematically22, the entrainment
problem and the possible feedback with aerosol, as noted in this
study, reflect the fundamental complexity of a multi-scale chaotic
system.
As one of the cornerstones in parameterizing the PBL23,24, a
linear scheme has been used to characterize the vertical heat
fluxes and the relationship between surface SH fluxes (FHS) and
entrainment fluxes (FHzi) in popular models such as the Weather
Research and Forecasting25 and the European Centre for Medium-
Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF24,26). The following widely used
parameterization was initially proposed by Ball27, followed by
Betts28 and Deardorff29:
Ai ¼ FHzi=FHS;
(1)
where Ai is called the entrainment parameter. In this way, the
entrainment fluxes can be derived from the surface fluxes21,25.
While the entrainment parameter is set as an empirical constant in
the previously mentioned studies, we argue that Ai can vary
considerably with aerosol properties and vertical distributions.
Aerosols may come into play in two ways. First, aerosol can reduce
the surface sensible heat by diminishing sunlight, thus weakening
entrainment and shallowing the PBL. Second, aerosols can modify
the thermodynamic structure in the PBL and cause a deviation
from the linear structure of heat fluxes, modifying the entrain-
ment. The former effect has been widely recognized13,16,20,
whereas the latter remains largely uncertain, motivating this study.
Using comprehensive field observations made in Beijing, China,
we examined the response of the entrainment process to aerosols.
In particular, we obtained the entrainment rate from the lidar-
derived PBL growth. In harmony with variations in aerosol
radiative forcing, drastic changes in entrainment rates are noted
for
different
aerosol
loadings.
Besides
its
loading,
aerosol
absorptions and vertical distributions can exert strong and
nonlinear impacts on the vertical distribution of buoyancy,
affecting the entrainment process. We propose a mechanism of
aerosol-entrainment coupling to demonstrate the notable inter-
actions between aerosols and the entrainment process in the
vertical. As a critical part of API, such an aerosol-entrainment
coupling leads to a much greater sensitivity of observed
entrainment rates to aerosols than suggested by traditional
calculations.

In this paper, we examine the aerosol effects on the vertical structure of precipitation in East China by matching GPM DPR (Global
Precipitation Measurement Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar) and MERRA-2 (Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and
Applications, Versions2) datasets. It was found that the increase of aerosol will obviously increase the precipitation frequency when
AOD (Aerosol Optical Depth) ≤0.5, but the excessive aerosol suppresses the precipitation frequency when AOD > 0.5 in some
regions. The AOD obviously enhances the radar echo intensity of precipitation and has a stronger impact on convective
precipitation. The correlation between AOD and rain rate, and that between AOD and STH (storm top height) are different in
different regions of East China. The aerosol reduces the mean droplet concentration in most regions except NC (Northeast China).
In most cases, aerosol increases the effective radius of precipitation and has a higher impact on convective precipitation.","INTRODUCTION
Aerosols, the key components of the atmosphere produced by
both natural processes and anthropogenic activities, impinge on
Earth’s climate and hydrological cycle by altering the radiative
balance of the atmosphere and precipitation formation1–3. IPCC4
divided aerosols effects into the aerosol–radiation interaction (ARI)
and the aerosol–cloud interaction (ACI), which describe how
aerosols affect the scattering and absorption of radiation and
cloud properties, respectively5–7. The different influence degrees
of aerosols are reflected in the changes of various meteorological
parameters, especially the changes in basic meteorological
elements, such as temperature and precipitation8–13.
The effects of aerosols on precipitation are essential but poorly
understood, and many scholars have carried out a series of
studies about that14–17. Aerosols affect precipitation through ARI
and ACI processes18. Rosenfeld et al.7 found that aerosols can
both decrease and increase rainfall as a result of their radiative
and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activities. Li et al.3 further
show that precipitation frequency and rain rate are altered by
aerosols. They observed that rain increases with aerosol in deep
clouds that have a high liquid-water content, but declines in
clouds that have a low liquid-water content. Koren et al.19 pointed
out that the turning zone exists in the influence of aerosols on
clouds and precipitation. Using TRMM PR precipitation datasets
along with MODIS Aerosols products, Dong et al.17 studied the
potential impacts of Sahara dust on the rainfall vertical structure
and found that dust aerosols can raise the storm height of
stratiform rain significantly.
East China is one of the fastest developing regions in China.
Since the reform and opening up in the late 1970s, the
concentrations of sulfuric acid, carbonaceous and mineral dust
aerosols have increased obviously in China13, especially in East
China. A large number of aerosols will reduce air quality, change
atmospheric physical and chemical properties, and then affect
weather and climate. In recent years, the East China has
experienced a frequency of continuous and severe haze pollution,
catching extensive concern of scholars20–26. Using MERRA-2
dataset, Xu26 presented the long-term variations of surface and
column black carbon over East China. Using 3 years of 3-hourly
observations made in heavily polluted eastern China, Jiang et al.18
concluded that rainfall amounts from deep convective clouds
increased at first and then decreased as aerosol optical depth
increased. Guo et al.27 found that China is above this zone with an
increasing aerosol trend, and the United States is below it with a
decreasing trend, but they have similar reductions in local-scale
precipitation (LSP) hours. While many studies have revealed the
effect of aerosol on precipitation over China, few have studied the
aerosol effects on the vertical and microphysical structure of
precipitation in East China. To fully understand the effects,
accurate microphysical parameters with high vertical resolution
are required. Historically, most three-dimensional precipitation
data since 1997 are from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission

(TRMM

However,
microphysical
precipitation parameters are not available in TRMM PR. Air-
borne Radar and Ground Based Radar can provide microphysical
data about precipitation but the method is challenging and costly,
and it is also difficult to obtain data in real time. Besides, ground-
based radar cannot serve this role because ground radar’s vertical
resolution is poor at the far range.
In addition to high vertical resolution precipitation data, the
acquisition of aerosol data near the precipitation events is also
one of the difficulties for study. The main characteristics of aerosol
pollution are complex components, large transmission range, and
widely distributed in the vertical direction. In the past, field

Understanding the behavior of western boundary current systems is crucial for predictions of biogeochemical cycles, fisheries, and
basin-scale climate modes over the midlatitude oceans. Studies indicate that anthropogenic climate change induces structural
changes in the Kuroshio Extension (KE) system, including a northward migration of its oceanic jet. However, changes in the KE
temporal variability remain unclear. Using large ensembles of a global coupled climate model, we show that in response to
increasing greenhouse gases, the time scale of KE sea surface height (SSH) shifts from interannual scales toward decadal and longer
scales. We attribute this increased low-frequency KE variability to enhanced mid-latitude oceanic Rossby wave activity induced by
regional and remote atmospheric forcing, due to a poleward shift of midlatitude surface westerly with climatology and an increase
in the tropical precipitation activity, which lead to stronger atmospheric teleconnections from El Niño to the midlatitude Pacific and
the KE region. Greenhouse warming leads to both a positive (elongated) KE state that restricts ocean perturbations (e.g., eddy
activity) and stronger wind-driven KE fluctuations, which enhances the contributions of decadal KE modulations relative to short-
time scale intrinsic oceanic KE variations. Our spectral analyses suggest that anthropogenic forcing may alter the future
predictability of the KE system.","INTRODUCTION
The Kuroshio Extension (KE) is an eastward inertial meandering jet
of the Kuroshio current located east of Japan, exhibiting the
largest air-sea fluxes and the strongest mesoscale eddy activity
across the North Pacific basin1,2. The KE is a major part of the
Pacific western boundary currents (WBCs) system that transports
substantial heat from the tropics to midlatitudes and subsequently
releases most of that heat to the atmosphere via turbulent fluxes
of latent and sensible heat3. The strongly coupled KE system
dynamically interacts with the extratropical Pacific storm track as a
midlatitude oceanic frontal zone4–7 and, in turn, further impacts
large-scale climate modes over the midlatitude Pacific8–12.
Pacific sea surface height (SSH) variability is most prominent in
the KE region [33°–40°N, 140°–165°E] (black box in Fig. 1a) on
seasonal-to-decadal timescales. Changes in the eddy kinetic
energy (EKE) field over the upstream [140°–153°E] KE region (left
box in Fig. 1b) largely contribute to the seasonal-to-interannual
time scales of KE variability13,14. This short-time scale KE variation
is strongly linked to oceanic intrinsic nonlinearities, characterized
by an apparent bimodality3,15–18. The bimodal KE fluctuations
include an elongated state, when the EKE level decreases and the
KE jet is relatively straight and stable, and a contracted state, in
which the EKE increases with a spatially convoluted KE path and
large meanders19,20. EKE changes are mainly caused by oceanic
instability regarding the internal adjustment via the convergence
of eddy heat flux and also non-linear interactions of the strong
current and eddies21. In contrast, basin-wide wind changes over
the midlatitudes are the primary forcing of the decadal variability
of KE SSH flucutations2,10,20,22–26. Specifically, atmospheric forcing
associated with the North Pacific internal variability, which is also
largely associated with El Niño and Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
atmospheric teleconnections and their imprints on the “redness”
of the spectrum27,28, drives oceanic baroclinic adjustment that
carries wind-induced oceanic Rossby waves westwards towards
the WBCs, especially the downstream [153°–165°E] KE region
(right box in Fig. 1b)2,10,20,22–26. Oceanic Rossby waves are also
closely linked to low-frequency variations in the southern
recirculation gyre intensity and the latitudinal migration of the
KE
jet2,13,20,29.
Satellite
altimeter
measurements
and
eddy-
resolving ocean simulations have shown that the positive KE state
(e.g., above-normal KE SSH anomalies) is accompanied by a
strengthened
southern
recirculation
gyre
and
a
northward-
displaced zonal-mean KE path29.
Large-scale oceanic Rossby waves modulate not only the
physical characteristics of the WBCs but also the local eddy
activity of the KE13,14,20,25,30,31. Interactions between the wind-
forced and intrinsic eddy variability in eddy-resolving hindcast
simulations reveal that the positive (negative) KE state can be
described as the elongated (contracted) state, where the internal
ocean perturbations are restricted (favored)15,29. The forced and
intrinsic KE variability vary in their respective contributions to the
total signal over time32,33. Since the mid-1980s, the decadal
modulation of the KE variability has become more robust and
prominent34. Given that the dominant forcing of the KE
dynamics modulates KE temporal behavior, the relative impact
of the oceanic (i.e., intrinsic) versus atmospheric (i.e., forced)
drivers on the KE region could be a key source of predictability
for KE variability.
Model studies suggest that global warming is associated with
intensification and/or a poleward shift of the KE jet in conjunction
with systematic changes in wind stress, ocean stratification, and
the southern recirculation gyre over the midlatitude Pacific35–40.
While these many studies have documented the response of
spatial characteristics of the KE system to a warming climate,

The Arctic environment has changed profoundly in recent decades. Aerosol particles are involved in numerous feedback
mechanisms in the Arctic, e.g., aerosol-cloud/radiation interactions, which have important climatic implications. To understand
changes in different Arctic aerosol types and number concentrations, we have performed a trend analysis of particle number size
distributions, their properties, and their associated air mass history at Villum Research Station, northeastern Greenland, from 2010
to 2018. We found that, during spring, the total/ultrafine mode number concentration and the time air masses spent over the open
ocean is significantly increasing, which can be ascribed to transport patterns changing to more frequent arrival from the ice-free
Greenland Sea. We found that, during summer, the total/ultrafine mode number concentration, the occurrence of the Nucleation
cluster (i.e. newly formed particles from gas to particle conversion), and the time air masses spent over the open ocean is
significantly increasing. This can also be attributed to changing transport patterns, here with air masses arriving more frequently
from Baffin Bay. Finally, we found that, during autumn, the ultrafine number concentration and the occurrence of the Pristine cluster
(i.e. clean, natural Arctic background conditions) is significantly increasing, which is likely due to increasing amounts of
accumulated precipitation along the trajectory path and decreasing time air masses spent above the mixed layer, respectively. Our
results demonstrate that changing circulation and precipitation patterns are the factors predominantly affecting the trends in
aerosol particle number concentrations and the occurrence of different aerosol types in northeastern Greenland.","INTRODUCTION
Aerosols are one of the most important, yet uncertain, factors in
determining the surface energy balance in the Arctic1. They can
directly affect the surface energy budget through scattering and
absorption of light (direct radiative effects) and indirectly through
the modification of cloud microphysical properties (indirect
radiative effects)2,3. However, the processes of natural Arctic
aerosols and their effects on the radiative balance are poorly
characterized in global climate models, thus a more complete
understanding of the factors affecting the aerosol burden is
pertinent for the prediction of the future Arctic climate4.
In the Arctic, there are strong seasonal variations in aerosol
particle number size distributions and concentrations, with long-
range transport of accumulation (Acc) mode particles (particles
with a diameter (Dp) > 100 nm) in late winter and early spring and
local production of ultrafine (UF) mode particles (Dp < 100 nm) in
the summer and autumn seasons5–10. Expansion of the polar
dome, limited turbulent transfer due to stably stratified atmo-
spheric layers, and inefficient wet removal in the late winter and
early spring allow for the long-range transport and accumulation
of anthropogenic pollution (e.g., sulfate and black carbon) in the
lower Arctic11–16, resulting in the Arctic haze phenomenon17.
During the summer, contraction of the polar dome, increase in
wet removal, and retreating sea ice cause regional sources of
aerosols and precursor gases to become more dominant, which is
manifested in an increase in nucleation and Aitken mode particles
through
new
particle
formation
(NPF)
and
subsequent
growth8,18–22. Marine and cryosphere emissions of dimethyl
sulfide (DMS) and iodine-containing compounds can photoche-
mically oxidize into low-volatility vapors (e.g., sulfuric acid and
iodic acid), which can initiate new particle formation and undergo
further condensational growth to sizes that can affect cloud
condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations23 and thus the atmo-
spheric radiative budget indirectly24–26. These emissions have
been shown to proceed under biotic (marine biological activity in
the marginal ice zone) and abiotic (photochemically induced
snowpack emissions) conditions27,28. Biogenic sources can also
contribute to the atmospheric burden of aerosol particles through
the direct emission of primary particles, especially in the summer
months29–32.
Changes in the atmospheric burden of aerosol particles have
been observed within the Arctic. Recently, Heslin-Rees et al.33
showed that coarse mode aerosols (most likely of sea spray origin)
have increased over the past 2 decades (1999–2016) at Zeppelin
Observatory on Svalbard. This was mainly due to changing air
mass circulation patterns, with air masses more frequently arriving
from the Northern Atlantic, with sea ice decrease having only a
marginal influence. Collaud Coen et al.34 recently demonstrated
that aerosol radiative properties in the polar regions showed a mix
of increasing and decreasing trends, which were seasonally and
spatially inhomogeneous. Moffett et al.35 analyzed summertime
particulate methanesulfonic acid (MSA) and non-sea-salt sulfate
(nns-SO42−) concentrations at Utqiaġvik (formerly known as
Barrow), AK from 1998–2017, an increase of 2.5 and 2.1% yr−1

The sixth assessment report of the IPCC indicates low-to-high confidence in trends of extreme rainfall with regional inconsistency in
the tropics, where a key phenomenon causing intra-seasonal variations in weather is the Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO). It
remains unknown how the MJO-induced extreme rainfall and the societal exposure may change in response to global warming and
climate mitigation attempts. Here, using eight CMIP6 models that capture the eastward-propagating MJO structure and amplitude,
we detect a nearly 60% increase in extreme rainfall over tropical Asia and Australia by the end of the 21st century under the fossil-
fueled warming scenario (SSP5-8.5); 84% of this change is associated with MJO-induced extreme rainfall. Extreme rainfall increases
are modulated by the warming-induced asymmetric changes in MJO phase characteristics, occurring mostly over the lands with
distinct zonal differences. The region that is most likely to be affected includes Malaysia, Indonesia, and northern Australia where
96.68 million people and 9.72 million km2 of urban areas are exposed to potential danger stemming from extreme rainfall. More
than 95% (99%) of the population (urban) exposure can be potentially avoided under the “middle of the road” development (SSP2-
4.5) scenario, whereby CO2 emissions hover around current levels before starting to fall mid-century.","INTRODUCTION
Nearly 300 million people worldwide are exposed to annual
floods, causing more than US$651 billion loss per year over the
past two decades1. Flooding triggered by extreme rainfall is
particularly frequent and destructive in low-lying and rapidly
developing tropical regions of Asia and Oceania. The vulnerability
of the region to extreme precipitation was on display in December
2020 when widespread flooding impacted southern Thailand and
Indonesia, killing at least 34 people, damaging 587,100 residential
houses, and causing 60 million USD economic loss2. More than 25
major floods or severe weather events causing substantial
damage were reported in Southeast Asia and tropical Oceania in
the boreal winter season (months from November to April) of
2020 (ref. 2). The recently released sixth assessment report (AR6,
ref. 3) emphasized that extreme precipitation will likely increase in
the tropics under continued global warming, but with consider-
able regional inconsistency, as well as uncertainty pertaining to
the mechanisms triggering extreme rainfall4–6. Meanwhile, the
Paris Agreement aims to reach a net-zero greenhouse gas
emission target and limit warming below 2 °C of pre-industrial
levels7. Uncertainties exist whether the implementation of global
climate mitigation strategies, mainly initiated by mid-latitude
countries, will have an effect on vulnerable regions of the tropics
where future extreme rainfall is projected to impact greater
populations and cause increased levels of damage owing to
acceleration in the global hydrological cycle1,8.
The most important triggering mechanism associated with
extreme rainfall at intra-seasonal scale over tropical Asia and
northern Australia is the Madden–Julian Oscillation9,10, which is
the several-thousand-km envelope of clouds, winds, and rainfall
that moves eastwards along the equator with a 20–90 day
timescale during the boreal winter season11 (Supplementary Fig.
1). The MJO induces precipitation anomalies within alternating
regions of enhanced and suppressed convection12,13. Extreme
rainfall events may occur when the MJO is in an enhanced
convective state that affects weather not only in its immediate
geographical location but in areas leading and trailing its
path14–16. In addition, the MJO affects extratropical regions
through exciting Rossby waves, leading to the far-reached MJO
teleconnections in the North Pacific and North Atlantic17,18.
Many studies have made projections on changes in MJO activity
in a warming climate via Earth System Models (ESMs)13,19–21, but it
remains unclear how changes in MJO-induced extreme rainfall
may influence the societal exposure in response to future
warming and climate mitigation attempts22. Such efforts rely on
accurate simulation of MJO processes in ESMs. However, most
CMIP5 models largely underestimate MJO amplitude and fail to
reproduce a coherent eastward propagation of MJO23. Recently,
some CMIP6 ESMs have demonstrated substantial improvements
in simulating the structure of MJO mainly due to the reasonable
simulation of horizontal moisture advection over the Maritime
Continent of tropical Southeast Asia24. These model advances
create an opportunity to address the dynamics of MJO-related
extreme rainfall and its potential socio-economic consequences in
the coming decades.
Here, using climate model outputs for various global warming
scenarios, we investigate projected changes in the MJO contribu-
tion to regional extreme rainfall, along with associated changes in
the exposure of population and urban areas in tropical Southeast
Asia and northern Australia to extreme precipitation during the
boreal winter seasons when MJO is the most enhanced11,12. First,
we compare historical-simulation outputs of selected CMIP6
models with fields derived from reanalysis data and precipitation
observations to evaluate the capability and accuracy of the
ensemble simulations in capturing MJO structure and associated
precipitation (Supplementary Tables

The use of air quality monitoring networks to inform urban policies is critical especially where urban populations are exposed to
unprecedented levels of air pollution. High costs, however, limit city governments’ ability to deploy reference grade air quality
monitors at scale; for instance, only 33 reference grade monitors are available for the entire territory of Delhi, India, spanning
1500 sq km with 15 million residents. In this paper, we describe a high-precision spatio-temporal prediction model that can be used
to derive fine-grained pollution maps. We utilize two years of data from a low-cost monitoring network of 28 custom-designed low-
cost portable air quality sensors covering a dense region of Delhi. The model uses a combination of message-passing recurrent
neural networks combined with conventional spatio-temporal geostatistics models to achieve high predictive accuracy in the face
of high data variability and intermittent data availability from low-cost sensors (due to sensor faults, network, and power issues).
Using data from reference grade monitors for validation, our spatio-temporal pollution model can make predictions within 1-hour
time-windows at 9.4, 10.5, and 9.6% Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) over our low-cost monitors, reference grade monitors,
and the combined monitoring network respectively. These accurate fine-grained pollution sensing maps provide a way forward to
build citizen-driven low-cost monitoring systems that detect hazardous urban air quality at fine-grained granularities.","INTRODUCTION
Pollution prediction in cities with dense populations can be critical
for generating fine-grained policy recommendations and public
health warnings1–3. The scale of accurate sensor-based monitoring
required to achieve this can come at a huge cost and thus inhibit
building a
dense fine-grained pollution
sensing
map. The
deployment of low-cost particulate matter sensors to replace or
augment reference grade pollution air quality monitoring systems
has been studied extensively recently, and have addressed issues
of calibration4–6, design7,8, data selection9, and personal exposure
quantification10,11. However, building a highly accurate large scale
fine-grained pollution sensing and monitoring map that leverages
the size of a pollution network has been largely unexplored.
Specifically, modeling the behavior of noisy low-cost sensors in
cities with high pollution and population density has not been
studied
previously,
with
recent
state-of-the-art
mapping
approaches providing errors only in the range of 30–40%12,13.
This high error lends the pollution sensing map unusable for
policymaking and air quality hazard detection. Prior work on
deploying low-cost sensor networks for air pollution have been
successful on a small scale (within 2 km radius) with high rates of
agreement for PM 2.5 measurements in Southeastern United
States14. Survey studies have shown that there is a necessity for a
paradigm shift towards crowd-funded sensor networks to enable
fine-grained sensing-based applications on a large scale15. The
question of calibration issues in such large scale settings has been
explored recently with promising results without the need for
significant recalibration16 after well-controlled laboratory calibra-
tion17. PM 2.5 prediction models recently have explored deep
neural networks like long-short term memory (LSTM), convolution
neural networks (CNN), attention-based models; vector regression,
partial differential equations, but focus on a single unified model
at a single location, rather than in a large scale sensor network
setting18–24.
Recent work has also explored the use of distributed sensor
networks to gather information on air pollution and other
meteorological variables in urban contexts25–29. Clements et al. 30
provide a comprehensive review of many such works. Researchers
have sought to learn more about how pollution sensing systems of
low-cost sensors may be deployed in urban contexts14,31–36. With
the exception of Gao et al. 36, who examine the performance of
fine
particulate
sensors
in
Xi’an
in
China,
most
of
these
deployments have occurred in areas with significantly lower air
pollution than the city of Delhi in India. Gao et al. 36 also point out
that low-cost PM2.5 sensors may perform worse in very low
pollution environments, suggesting that they may be relatively
more useful when particulate concentrations are high. Related
approaches in this space can be broadly classified into three
groups—spatial interpolation approaches, land-use regression, and
dispersion models Xie et al. 37, Jerrett et al. 38. In the case of
dispersion models, they assume that an appropriate chemical
transport model is identified along with their parameter values,
and a high-quality emissions inventory. In the case of land-use
regression models, having access to environmental characteristics
that significantly influence pollution is critical. This additional data
is often suited for longer range predictions, as the geographical
and meteorological data vary over a longer temporal and coarser
spatial grids39,40.
In this paper, we describe a methodology to model and predict
urban air quality at a fine-grained level using dense and noisy,

Eukarya dominate the coarse primary biological aerosol (PBA) above the Amazon rainforest canopy, but their vertical profile and
seasonality is currently unknown. In this study, the stratification of coarse and giant PBA >5 µm were analyzed from the canopy to
300 m height at the Amazon Tall Tower Observatory in Brazil during the wet and dry seasons. We show that >2/3 of the coarse PBA
were canopy debris, fungal spores commonly found on decaying matter were second most abundant (ranging from 15 to 41%),
followed by pollens (up to 5%). The atmospheric roughness layer right above the canopy had the greatest giant PBA abundance.
Measurements over 5 years showed an increased abundance of PBA during a low-rainfall period. Giant particles, such as pollen, are
reduced at 300 m, suggesting their limited dispersal. These results give insights into the giant PBA emissions of this tropical
rainforest, and present a major step in understanding the type of emitted particles and their vertical distribution.","INTRODUCTION
Primary biological aerosols (PBA) including bacteria, fungi, fern
and bryophyte spores, viruses, fragments of insects and leaves are
abundant in the atmosphere and are agents for the spread of
microorganisms and reproductive material, ranging in size from a
few nanometers up to several millimeters1–4. In the Amazon, air
sampling above and below the canopy has shown that fungal
spores dominate the coarse size range of suspended particles3,5.
About 90% of atmospheric particles <10 µm are composed of
organic material, irrespective of the season5–8.
In a recent wet-season study using fluorescence insitu
hydridization, coarse PBA were dominated by bacteria and
Eukaryotes, and the largest of these were greatly reduced at
300 m height. Also, up to 30% of coarse PBA were attributed to
biological debris9.
The smallest of the suspended particles are mostly secondary
organic aerosols, known to scatter and absorb radiation and
initiate the formation of clouds and precipitation by acting as
cloud condensation and ice nuclei6,10–13. It also was suggested
that a significant part of smaller particles originated from
primary emission, i.e., fungal discharge liquids and fragmented
spores14,15. In tropical regions, the regional circulation pattern
and evapotranspiration, together with bioaerosols, are impor-
tant factors shaping hydrological processes16–19.
The potential for vertical transport of coarse PBA and the role
they might play in cloud formation has been frequently
discussed. Some authors point out that PBA can act as giant
(usually >10 µm2) CCN in the atmosphere, whereby water
condenses on a large particle, producing a tail of large droplets
with
high
collection
efficiency,
enhancing
collision
and
coalescence processes, and influencing warm rain forma-
tion20–22. Thus, it is important to identify the sources and
measure the abundance of coarse PBA that are carried above
the rainforest canopy in order to estimate the PBA contribution
to CCN above the Amazon forest.
Vertical atmospheric lifting is a prerequisite for long-range
transport of aerosols and is related to and controlled by
pressure systems, convection and inversion layers23. Coarse PBA
have been reported to travel across countries and the ocean,
but these are believed to be rare events24. Daily regional
forecast models for atmospheric pollen abundance still assume
an even distribution from near ground level to the top of the
atmospheric boundary layer, i.e., to a height of ~1 km above
ground level25–27. However, many studies on the distribution of
pollen grains up to 100 m above ground showed that their
abundance was well-correlated with specific meteorological
conditions.25,26,28–31. Using aircraft measurements, high con-
centrations of aerosol particles were reported to be transported
across the boundary layer by strong convection30. However,
there is a paucity of long-term studies on PBA particles at fixed
heights and especially in tropical regions. In the central Amazon
rainforest, there are strong updrafts and downdrafts from
frequent deep convection events that could influence vertical
PBA transport.
In the current study, we conducted long-term tower-based
measurements at 5 height levels up to 300 m above ground to
identify coarse and giant PBA >5 µm in the Amazon rainforest
atmosphere. This profile was linked to meteorological data to infer
the seasonality effects on PBA vertical gradients.

In order to predict the impacts of reductions in air pollutant emissions, it is important to know whether secondary pollutant
concentrations will decline in direct proportion to the reduction in their precursor, referred to as linearity. Trends in airborne
concentrations of nitrate, sulfate, and SOC at sites in southern England are compared with emissions and concentration trends for
sulfur dioxide (SO2), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), and non-methane VOC, and show some increased ratios of concentrations to
emissions, strongly suggestive of non-linearity in the primary-secondary pollutant relationships for nitrate, but not the other
pollutants. Analysis of a further 20-year dataset from the AGANET network shows a decline of nitrate concentrations significantly
lower than that of NOx emissions and ambient NOx concentrations. For sulfate, the decline lies between that of emissions and
airborne concentrations of SO2. Back trajectory analysis and Potential Source Contribution Function mapping for 2014–2018 show
that the highest concentrations of secondary constituents in southern England are associated with air masses originating in
mainland Europe, with 42% of sulfate, 55% of nitrate, and 35% of SOC estimated to be associated with air masses entering the UK
from the European mainland.","INTRODUCTION
A decline in the emissions and hence airborne concentrations of
primary pollutants will in most cases lead to a reduction in
concentrations of related secondary pollutants. However, the
decline
in
secondary
pollutant
concentration
may
not
be
proportional to the reduction of its precursor, a phenomenon
known as non-linearity. In general, non-linearity works in the sense
of a less than proportionate decrease in the secondary pollutant,
and hence it is likely that many secondary pollutant concentra-
tions will not fall as rapidly as those of their main precursor.
Non-linearity is well known in gas phase atmospheric chemistry,
for example in the oxides of nitrogen-ozone system. In polluted
atmospheres, atmospheric photochemistry leads to net ozone
production from photolysis of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and peroxy
radical chemistry1. This is most efficient at quite low concentra-
tions of NO2, as NO2 is a sink for the hydroxyl radical (OH) which
plays a key role in sustaining the photochemistry in which ozone
is formed. Hence as NO2 concentrations reduce, at constant levels
of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) and sunlight, ozone
production efficiency rises leading to higher concentrations2.
The increased OH radical concentration will cause enhanced
oxidation of other compounds such as NO2, SO2, and VOC, leading
potentially to more nitrate, sulfate, and secondary organic aerosol
(SOA). This is likely to be a general phenomenon as many species
such as VOC, SO2 and NOx are sinks for atmospheric oxidants, and
as they reduce in concentration, so oxidants may increase leading
to faster formation rates of secondary pollutants. There are also
cases of direct oxidant limitation, in which oxidant availability
places a limit on the amount of a pollutant which can be oxidised,
and a fall in precursor does not reduce the amount of secondary
product if the precursor still exceeds the available oxidant3.
The secondary pollutants which contribute most to PM2.5 mass
are typically sulfate, nitrate, and secondary organic compounds4,5.
The clearest evidence of non-linearity deriving from atmospheric
measurements is for sulfate. Emissions of SO2 in Europe and North
America have reduced hugely in past decades, and this is reflected
in lower measured concentrations of both SO2 and sulfate. Jones
and Harrison6 examined the decline in concentrations at the EMEP
sites across Europe, finding a far less than linear reduction in
sulfate relative to SO2. Measurements in North America7 have
similarly shown a less than linear reduction in sulfate. Evidence
from measurements is much weaker for nitrate and secondary
organic compounds, in the former case due to a much shorter
history of emissions reductions for NOx than for SO2, and in the
latter case, the difficulty of making definitive measurements.
However, reduced road traffic emissions during periods of
lockdown due to Covid-19 have provided an opportunity for
evaluation of precursor-secondary component relationships8,9,
although these studies are more susceptible to effects of
variations in weather than the longer-term datasets. Li et al.10
show complex non-linear responses of nitrate aerosol to controls
on NOx emissions in major cities of China, as did Balamurugan
et al.11 in German cities. A recent paper by Pye et al.12 shows a
high degree of linearity between emissions of SO2, NOx, and VOC
and their ambient concentrations over the period 2002 to 2019 in
the United States. The associated model study shows an
interaction between pollutants, as well as regional variations in
secondary pollutant reductions, which are mostly less than linear.
Numerical models are the only means of predicting future
changes in secondary pollutant concentrations. These present
particular difficulties and consequent uncertainties, which may be
greater than for other pollutants. Specific issues include the ones
described below.

Global warming exerts a strong impact on the Earth system. Despite recent progress, Earth System Models still project a large range
of possible warming levels. Here we employ a generalized stochastic climate model to derive a response operator which computes
the global mean surface temperature given specific forcing scenarios to quantify the impact of past emissions on current warming.
This approach enables us to systematically separate between the “forcing-induced direct” and the “memory-induced indirect”
trends. Based on historical records, we find that the direct-forcing-response is weak, while we attribute the major portion of the
observed global warming trend to the indirect-memory responses that are accumulated from past emissions. Compared to
CMIP6 simulations, our data-driven approach projects lower global warming levels over the next few decades. Our results suggest
that CMIP6 models may have a higher transient climate sensitivity than warranted from the observational record, due to them
having larger long-term memory than observed.","INTRODUCTION
The climate crisis is of utmost concern to both the climate science
community and the public1. The 2015 Paris Agreement has set a
target of limiting the global temperature increase in this century
to 2.0 oC, while trying at the same time to pursue a more
ambitious target to limit the increase to 1.5 oC. Substantially
different impacts between the warming of 1.5 and 2.0 oC have
been widely reported2,3. To cope with this unprecedented
challenge, effective actions are urgently needed4,5, and reliable
estimations of climate response to anthropogenic greenhouse gas
emissions are required.
The global climate system has a huge inertia6, delaying the
temperature response to changes in greenhouse gas concentra-
tions. Of the heat resulting from anthropogenic greenhouse gas
emissions, more than 90% is stored in the ocean7. The ocean can
in turn affect the air temperatures as well as the entire climate
system in a slow and persistent way. Accordingly, even if no more
carbon dioxide were emitted to the atmosphere now, or more
realistically speaking, if the target of carbon neutralization were
achieved, the global temperature may still rise for decades to
reach an equilibrium state. For instance, for the estimation of the
Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS), thousands of years of model
simulations are needed to obtain the ECS8, which requires massive
computational resources, but the estimate would still have a large
uncertainty attached to it due to structural model issues9,10. Note
that a more popular way, compared to the way of running models
for thousands of years, is to estimate the ECS from a short, e.g.,
4 × CO2 climate model experiment assuming the relationship
between the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiative imbalance N and
the global mean surface temperature change ΔT is linear as
N = F −λΔT11. However, the facts that (i) the climate response is
nonlinear12 and (ii) the feedback parameter λ varies over time
scales13 make the estimation still challenging. In order to better
design adaptation strategies, understanding how the global
temperature reacts to the anthropogenic radiative forcing is an
urgent issue.
Ever since the middle of the last century, when the “Hurst
Phenomenon” was discovered14,15, it has been recognized that
many climate variables are characterized by long-term climate
memory14,16–19, which is relevant for understanding the inertia in
the climate system. Different from the short-term memory, which
describes the persistence of a given process on weather scales
(i.e., a few days to around two weeks), long-term climate memory
depicts the scaling behavior of multiple processes of different
time scales. This cascade represents how multi-scale processes
affect each other, i.e., fast processes may force slow processes to
change, while slow processes may modulate the variations of fast
processes on a longer scale20. Consequently, time series with
scaling behaviors are characterized by the persistence of much
longer time scales. This property is called long-term memory14.
Based on the classical Brownian Motion and Random Walk
theories, various approaches such as the Fluctuation Analysis
(FA)21, the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA)22, have been
developed and widely used over the past few decades to quantify
the strength of the long-term climate memory in different climatic
variables ranging from surface air temperatures19,23, sea surface
temperatures24 and precipitation18, to relative humidity16, sea
level17, and the atmospheric general circulation25. A physically
understandable finding was that the air temperatures of islands
have stronger long-term climate memory than those from inner
continents, thus highlighting the impacts of the ocean heat
capacity24,26. If large-scale spatially averaged temperatures (e.g.,
global mean surface temperature) are considered, strong climate
memory has been reported27, which is in line with the fact that the
ocean may store the heat and release it back to the atmosphere

Rapid Arctic warming has altered the regional hydrological cycle through reduction in Arctic sea ice. Observational and modeling
efforts provided evidence that the enhanced evaporation from the Arctic Ocean could increase snowfall over high latitude
terrestrial zones. However, questions remain regarding the amount of equatorward moisture transport and its change over the
decadal timescale. Here we show that the transport of atmospheric moisture to Siberia that originated from Arctic Ocean
evaporation has increased significantly in autumn to early winter during 1981–2019 when substantial sea ice retreat was observed.
The enhanced Arctic moisture content is found in western Siberia in September, consistent with the observed increase in snow
cover investigated in earlier studies. Meanwhile, the annual maximum daily amount of Arctic moisture shows a sharp increase in
eastern Siberia during October–December associated with cyclonic activities along coastal regions. Our results suggest the
importance of monitoring equatorward moisture transport during snow accumulation seasons because it could enhance local
snowstorms as evaporation from the Arctic Ocean increases in the near future.","INTRODUCTION
There is growing concern in relation to the influence of climate
change on the natural environment and on human socioeconomic
activities. The impacts of climate change extend globally but with
substantial inhomogeneity. Among Earth’s various environmental
systems, those that exist in the Arctic and circum-Arctic regions
have been affected strongly by rapid warming, which is projected
to continue at a rate approximately twice that of the global mean1.
The enhanced warming in the Arctic region, referred to as Arctic
amplification, is not simply a local issue because it weakens the
latitudinal thermal gradient, causing jet meandering that could
possibly trigger abnormal weather in mid-latitude regions2. The
accelerated warming in the Arctic is maintained by complex
interactive processes that encompass components of the ocean,
land, and atmosphere. In such interactions, the hydrological cycle
plays a focal role by regulating ice–albedo feedback and radiative
energy transfer3.
The issues that remain unexplained with respect to the
hydrological cycle include the effect of Arctic warming on
continental snowfall. During seasonal transitions, snow cover
predominantly regulates the surface energy budget. Many earlier
studies demonstrated that snow cover exerts a memory effect in
which the signal of a hydrometeorological episode is stored as a
snow cover anomaly during the cold season, and that this signal
re-emerges several months later during the snowmelt season to
reinforce the atmosphere4,5. Therefore, knowledge of a precursor
signal stored as a snow cover anomaly is expected to help
improve seasonal prediction of abnormal weather, e.g., the
potential for modulation of the likelihood of heatwaves6,7 that
enhance the risk of fire in boreal forests8,9.
The recent rapid reduction in Arctic sea ice and evident
warming of the Arctic Ocean are likely to increase snow cover over
northern Eurasia10–12. It was revealed that heavy snowfall events
over Europe are attributable to atmospheric moisture supplied
from the Barents Sea, and that such a mechanism explains the
decadal change in snowfall over the Scandinavian Peninsula12. It is
reasonable to hypothesize that similar pathways of equatorward
moisture transport exist across northern Siberia where the
distance from the low- and mid-latitude oceans is large. An
idealized general circulation model experiment predicted that an
ice-free Arctic Ocean would increase the extent of snow cover
over Siberia10. A Lagrangian moisture transport model showed
consistent results, whereby the airmass over the Arctic Ocean
acquires more humidity in years with low ice cover, which
increases precipitation over western Siberia11. Despite these
earlier
efforts,
questions
remain
regarding
the
amount
of
equatorward moisture transport that originates from the Arctic
Ocean and its change over the decadal timescale. Therefore, the
objective of this study was to quantify the fraction of water vapor
evaporated from the Arctic Ocean, and to investigate its transport
to northern Eurasia, particularly Siberia, during recent decades
when Arctic sea ice retreat has been remarkable. The analysis was
conducted using a tagged moisture transport model (“Methods”).
Because the model was driven using a reanalysis dataset, we
attempted to diagnose the reality of the effects of the moisture
released from the Arctic Ocean.

Transport and transformation of urban air pollutants are among the major factors driving the changes in the atmospheric
composition in the downwind rural/remote areas of a megacity. Here, we assess the impacts of urban air pollution in a subtropical
forest through characterization of the organic markers in submicron aerosol particles. The aerosol samples were collected and
analyzed using TD-PTR-ToF-MS, where 163 ions were detected. The concentration of these extracted ions accounts for 83% of the
mass of submicron organic aerosols, which are accordingly characterized by a median formula of C7H10O2. Molecular speciation
indicates that urban and biomass burning pollution contributed substantially to the budget of organic aerosols, which were
enhanced particularly by the liquid water content and acidity of the aerosols. Our results evidence that the footprint of urban air
pollution was extended to its downwind forested areas and caused changes in the concentration and composition of submicron
aerosols.","INTRODUCTION
The impact of anthropogenic emission of trace gases from urban
areas to biogenic environment is still uncertain, particularly in
terms of how urban air pollutants can modify the levels of reactive
compounds and natural atmospheric chemical pathways1. The
complex interaction between urban and biogenic species can
influence
atmospheric
oxidation
capacity2
and
modify
the
production and, thereby, ambient concentration of aerosols3–6.
Understanding the changes in the natural atmospheric conditions
due to the transport of pollutants from urban areas, particularly
the megacities, is essential to accurately describe the influences of
urbanization on regional atmospheric chemistry.
A typical approach of evaluating the perturbation of anthro-
pogenic pollutants is to identify and account for the tracers
associated with human endeavors. Such an approach is based on
a hypothesis that the ambient concentration of the specific tracers
increases with the strength of corresponding activities. Estimating
the mass contribution of these tracers in a clean and biogenic
environment where only natural processes partake may provide
an ideal case to test the hypothesis. Several traditional tracers in
gas and particle-phase have been effectively characterized and
attributed to specific sources7–10. For instance, carbon monoxide
(CO) is produced from the incomplete combustion of fossil/bio
fuels, which makes it a typical tracer of urban plumes. However,
the assessment of CO emission is associated with a large
uncertainty due to variable sources of CO, which also include
the natural biomass burning (BB) and oxidation of biogenic
volatile organic compounds (BVOCs)11. Also, potassium ion (K+) is
customarily tagged as a marker of biomass burning (BB) but it also
has an apparent contribution from sea spray in coastal areas and
resuspension of soil from fertilized cropland in agricultural areas.
Because of the relatively well-characterized emissions of volatile
organic compounds (VOCs) from various urban sources, the VOCs
and their respective oxidation products in aerosols have been
suggested as source-specific markers of urban air pollution in the
atmosphere12,13.
In this study, the perturbation of anthropogenic processes in a
subtropical forest during the fall season of 2015 is evaluated
through a comprehensive characterization of submicron organic
aerosols, which includes analysis of source, size distribution, liquid
water content (LWC), pH, and saturation concentration. Although
several studies have previously shown the influence of urban
emissions on the atmospheric conditions of forest environ-
ments1,3,14, only a handful of observations were implemented in
biogenic sites in the East Asia Region that is heavily impacted by
both local and regional pollution events. The forested area in this
study is located downwind of the major urban area in central
Taiwan, where a substantial amount of air pollutants are emitted
from sources like coal-fired power plants, vehicles, and industrial
factories. The urban air pollutants are transported to the forested
site with the aid of mountain-valley circulation15. Moreover,
Taiwan is located in the downwind area of East Asian winter
monsoons and receives transboundary atmospheric pollutants
originating in the Chinese megacities during the cold seasons16,17.
With the confounding sources of anthropogenic emissions,
investigation at this forested site can provide direct evidences of
the impact of human-related activities on the formation pathway
of organic aerosols. The influence of anthropogenic activities in

Marine new particle formation (NPF) can affect cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) in the global atmosphere. Recently, iodic acid (IA)
has been identified as a critical driver for marine NPF. However, atmospheric observations of IA cannot be associated with predicted
particle formation rates. Given the complexity of atmospheric components, other species may promote IA particle formation. As an
efficient stabilizer for acidic precursors, dimethylamine (DMA) has a wide distribution over the oceans. Hence, we investigated the
nucleation process of DMA and IA under different atmospheric conditions and uncovered the corresponding nucleating
mechanism using a quantum chemical approach and Atmospheric Cluster Dynamics Code (ACDC). The findings show that DMA can
structurally stabilize IA via hydrogen and halogen bonds, and the clustering process is energy barrierless. Moreover, DMA can
enhance the formation rate of IA clusters by five orders of magnitude, and its efficiency in promoting IA cluster formation is much
higher than that of NH3. Compared to the nucleation via sequential addition of IA, the IA-DMA nucleation plays a more dominant
role in nucleation kinetic. Thus, the effect of DMA on enhancing IA cluster stability and formation rate cannot be ignored, especially
in the regions near the source of IA and DMA emissions. Broadly, the proposed IA-DMA nucleation mechanism may help to explain
some missing sources of particles and, thus intensive marine NPF events.","INTRODUCTION
Marine aerosol acts as the most important natural aerosol system
in the world, significantly affecting global radiation balance and
climate system through further conversion to cloud condensation
nuclei (CCN)1,2. New particle formation (NPF) initiated via the
nucleating of gaseous molecules provides an important source of
atmospheric aerosol3,4. Hence, to better understand the marine
aerosol formation, the critical challenge involves the chemical

and
disentangling
the
corresponding nucleating mechanism at the molecular level5,6.
Globally, marine NPF are significantly influenced by biogenic
emissions, although anthropogenic impacts are also involved, to a
lesser extent, especially in the remote ocean7. Field observations
have shown that marine NPF is closely related to the iodine-
bearing molecules8, which originate from iodine vapors emitted
by marine algal9,10. Among these iodine components, iodic acid
(HIO3, IA) has been identified to be the key NPF driver in the
coastal, open ocean, and ice-covered polar regions11–13. However,
atmospheric observations of IA cannot be associated with
predicted particle formation rates14. Given the complexity of
atmospheric components, other widespread precursors over the
oceans, especially from biological emissions, may also be involved
in the formation process of IA particles. Amines (e.g., mono-
methylamine MA, dimethylamine DMA, and trimethylamine TMA),
as nitrogenous bases widely distributed in the atmosphere15,
possess relatively strong basicity and consequently stabilization
effect on acidic nucleation precursors such as well-known sulfuric
acid (SA)15,16 and methanesulfonic acid (MSA)17,18. As the stronger
stabilizer of these amine molecules (DMA ≥TMA > MA)16, the most
extensively studied DMA has been identified as a major nucleating
precursor in the coastal city of Shanghai, China19, coastal
California20, and over the open ocean21,22. Moreover, the wide-
spread DMA has a considerable atmospheric concentration
(0.4–10 pptv) over the ocean, making it important for marine
NPF23. Considering the ability of DMA to efficiently stabilize acidic
precursors and
its wide distribution
in the
marine atmo-
sphere24–27, there is a potential for DMA to stabilize IA molecules
via acid-base reactions. However, whether DMA is capable of rapid
clustering with IA and the corresponding nucleation process are
unknown at the molecular level.
To investigate the nucleation process of IA and DMA, the
combination of a quantum chemical method with Atmospheric
Clusters Dynamic Code (ACDC)28 were employed to simulate the
nucleation kinetic process. A multi-step conformational search was
systematically performed to identify stable conformations of
(IA)x.(DMA)y (1 ≤x ≤6, 1 ≤y ≤3, x + y ≤6) clusters with global
minima energy. The nature of IA binding with DMA within the

role of DMA in stabilizing IA clusters, the corresponding molecular-
level nucleating mechanism was further proposed by tracking the

Compound drought and heatwaves (DHW) events have much attention due to their notable impacts on socio-ecological systems.
However, studies on the mechanisms of DHW related to land-atmosphere interaction are not still fully understood in regional
aspects. Here, we investigate drastic increases in DHW from 1980 to 2019 over northern East Asia, one of the strong land-
atmosphere interaction regions. Heatwaves occurring in severely dry conditions have increased after the late 1990s, suggesting that
the heatwaves in northern East Asia are highly likely to be compound heatwaves closely related to drought. Moreover, the soil
moisture–temperature coupling strength increased in regions with strong increases in DHW through phase transitions of both
temperature and heat anomalies that determine the coupling strength. As the soil moisture decreases, the probability density of
low evapotranspiration increases through evaporative heat absorption. This leads to increase evaporative stress and eventually
amplify DHW since the late 1990s. In particular, seasonal changes in soil moisture and evapotranspiration between spring and
summer contributed to the amplification of DHW by enhancing land-atmosphere interaction.","INTRODUCTION
Compound extreme events have been steadily increasing over
recent decades, leading to significant environmental and social
impacts1–5. For instance, the 2012 drought in the central U.S.,
accompanied by high-temperature anomalies, cost at least $30
billion in large agricultural damage6. The heatwaves have been
delivering havoc across Europe in 2022, causing droughts,
wildfires, and deaths. These compound extreme events could
contribute to the onset of wildfires as well as the onset of rapidly
developing droughts, and their frequency is expected to increase7.
Moreover, compound temperature and precipitation extreme
events have decisive effects on the probability of increased crop
losses8. Extreme temperature and precipitation events such as
heatwaves and droughts have been widely investigated world-
wide9–11. Therefore, understanding and investigating compound
heat and precipitation extreme events is critical to mitigating
significant social and economic risks.
Regional differences in temperature and hydrological variables,
including precipitation, result in disparate spatial patterns for
compound extreme heat events12,13. Compound droughts and
heatwaves (DHW) develop according to the modulation of the
variety of land surface fluxes affected by surface dryness, climate
patterns, and anthropogenic forcing14,15. Relevant large-scale
effects of external forcing on extreme heat events include net
increases in temperature induced by changes in the enhanced
moisture content of the atmosphere, radiation, and circulation
patterns.

on

change affects these regions16,22. Changes in the balance of soil
moisture are increasingly being discussed in the recent climate
change studies because of the important role of soil moisture in
the land–atmosphere system.
Numerous studies have focused on the role of the interaction
between land and atmosphere to examine the simultaneous
occurrence of heatwaves and droughts17,21,23. Land surface states
can contribute to extreme temperature events such as heatwaves, in
particular, the number of heatwave days, through the surface energy
balance coincident with soil moisture deficits16,24,25. For instance, Li
et al.26 highlighted the role of soil moisture–atmospheric feedback in
future climate change, leading to increased temperature amplitude
and interannual variability. In addition, previous studies using
simulations of the Global Land-Atmosphere Coupling Experiment-
Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 revealed that drying
trends in soil moisture tend to intensify high-temperature extremes
and dryness27,28.
Soil moisture is a major variable of the land climate system
because it can alter the transmission and distribution of water and
energy on the land surface by changing the surface evapotran-
spiration, albedo, and soil thermal capacity. Previous studies have
shown that land-atmospheric feedback processes induced by soil
moisture anomalies participate in intensively controlling near-
surface heat and dryness via high-pressure structures in the mid-
troposphere19,20,25. Soil moisture continues to decrease in dry
regions, and the temperature increases sharply, with a strong
negative correlation. According to previous studies, arid and semi-
arid regions will be more severely stressed by climate change12.
Moreover, soil moisture/temperature interactions enhance tem-
perature variability in summer, causing extreme temperature
events as the soil moisture is dry16–20.

The Tropical Western-Central Indian Ocean (WCIO) precipitation anomalies play an important role in modulating the anomalous
climate conditions in the North Atlantic and European (NAE) region during the early boreal winter (November–December; ND)
season. In this study, we analyzed the forcing mechanism and predictability for the early winter tropical WCIO precipitation
anomalies and its teleconnections to the North Atlantic region. The two main forcing mechanisms emerging are the autumn Indian
Ocean Dipole (IOD) and a direct atmospheric teleconnection from El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Since the autumn IOD is
partially forced by ENSO, their independent contributions are also investigated. We found the IOD dominates over the ENSO
contribution. The ECMWF-SEAS5 seasonal re-forecast reproduces these forcing mechanisms well and shows a substantial prediction
skill for early winter WCIO precipitation. Moreover, the North Atlantic response to the positive WCIO phase projects spatially onto
the positive North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) phase through atmospheric teleconnections and leads to warming in central and
western Europe. This teleconnection is reproduced by ECMWF-SEAS5, but with weaker amplitude. Moreover, a significant prediction
skill for the NAO as well as for the central and western European temperature anomalies is noted, which is mostly induced by the
Indian Ocean precipitation anomalies during early winter.","INTRODUCTION
Understanding the mechanism for the North Atlantic Oscillation
(NAO)1 predictability that modulates and favors the extreme
climatic conditions in the North Atlantic European (NAE) region is
important. In recent decades, the warming in the Indian Ocean
favors frequent positive NAO2–5 conditions, which leads to mild
winters over the NAE region6, particularly during early winter
(November–December) when the Indian Ocean (IO) teleconnec-
tion dominates over the direct teleconnection from El Niño-
Southern Oscillation (ENSO)7,8.
Tropical Indian Ocean (TIO) interacts with the other oceanic
basins through atmospheric and oceanic pathways9–12. There are
two main modes of variability in the Indian Ocean, one is the
Indian Ocean Basin Mode (IOBM) and the other is the Indian
Ocean dipole (IOD). Both modes modulate the global climate
variability on different timescales13–16 and show strong season-
ality. The IOBM is forced by the El Niño-Southern Oscillation
(ENSO) and peaks in boreal spring following an ENSO event,
whereas the IOD peaks and shows maximum variability in boreal
autumn10. The IOD is defined as the see-saw of the Sea Surface
Temperatures (SSTs) anomalies between the western and the
southeastern Indian Ocean17. ENSO, through an atmospheric
bridge, also strongly interacts with the IOD mode18. ENSO
influences IOD due to an anomalous walker circulation, which
induces a low-level easterly flow that shallows the thermocline
over the eastern TIO which, in turn, strengthens the warm pool
over the western Indian Ocean during a warm ENSO event,
favoring the positive IOD phase. The ENSO-IOD relationship peaks
during the boreal autumn season16, but still about half of IOD
variability can exist independently. Recently, a very strong IOD
event developed during boreal autumn and early winter of 2019/
20, favoring the positive NAO phase during boreal winter that led
to extreme warm and wet climatic conditions over the North
Atlantic and European (NAE) region6 and drought-like conditions
that led to the extreme fires during the Australian summer season
in the southern hemisphere19. In general, Indian Ocean precipita-
tion anomalies induced by SST anomalies in the Indian Ocean and
ENSO region are important tropical sources for the eastward
propagating wave from the Indian Ocean leading to anomalous
atmospheric circulation anomalies in the NAE region7,8,20. Several

we used ECMWF-SEAS5 re-forecast data23 to investigate the

as for the NAE circulation anomalies in early boreal winter.
The importance of Indian Ocean induced NAE circulation
anomalies during the boreal winter season has been recognised
as an important source of predictability in coupled Ocean-
Atmosphere models on sub-seasonal to seasonal timescales24–29.
A considerable effort has been made to diagnose the Indian
Ocean teleconnections in coupled models24,26, but how well the
models are capable in predicting the precipitation anomalies in
the Indian Ocean during the boreal early winter season is not well
documented, which is thus investigated in the current study. In
the NAE region, NAO modulates the atmospheric circulation
anomalies and the surface anomalous conditions during boreal
winter30. However, the NAO prediction skill is limited during
boreal winter (December-February) compared to the Pacific North
American (PNA) skill, mainly due to a weaker ENSO teleconnec-
tion31–35. Nonetheless, there is some moderate predictability for
the NAO36 forced by the tropical oceans37, transmitted through
tropospheric7,38–41 and stratospheric pathways42–47. An interesting
aspect of the NAO prediction skill is that its actual prediction skill

Poleward migration is an interesting phenomenon regarding the shift of Tropical Cyclones (TCs) towards higher latitudes. As
climate warms, TCs’ intensification is promoted, and yet over certain oceans, TCs may also migrate poleward into colder waters. To
what extent this poleward shift can impact future TC’s intensification is unclear, and a quantitative understanding of these
competing processes is lacking. Through investigating one of the most likely TC basins to experience poleward migration, the
western North Pacific (WNP), here we explore the issue. Potential Intensity (PI, TC’s intensification upper bound) along TC’s
intensification locations (from genesis to the lifetime maximum intensity location) are analysed. We find that poleward migration
can partially cancel global warming’s positive impact on future WNP TC’s intensification. With poleward migration, the PI increasing
trend slope is gentler. We estimate that poleward migration can reduce the increasing trend slope of the proportion of Category-5
PI by 42% (22%) under a strong (moderate) emission pathway; and 68% (30%) increasing trend slope reduction for the average PI.","INTRODUCTION
Tropical cyclones (TCs) are severe natural disasters. How TCs will
change under anthropogenic climate change is of great con-
cern1–29. As climate warms, it has been projected that TCs may
move towards higher latitudes (poleward migration)30–40, how
poleward migration can impact future TC’s intensification is
therefore an important question to ask. Because poleward
migration may involve different TC metrics, e.g., genesis location,
lifetime maximum intensity (LMI) location, intensification track
(genesis to LMI) or the entire TC track30–40, this research focus on
the intensification track.
As TCs move towards higher latitudes, one would naturally
anticipate that poleward migration could negatively impact future
TC’s intensification, since TCs are also shifting towards a colder
(less favourable) ocean environment as climate warms. Never-
theless, how to quantify this impact is a complex issue. Though
high-resolution climate models simulate the projected intensity of
TCs and include the effect of poleward migration, this is only one
of the contributing factors to TC’s intensity change. In other words,
poleward
migration’s
effect
is
embedded,
but
not
readily
separable. To separate its effect, a reference case is required,
such that the only difference between the two cases is the effect
of poleward migration. However, it is challenging to set up that
properly in climate model simulations without modifying other
factors in such complex models.
This research thus proposes to use an alternative approach, the
Potential Intensity41–45 (PI) approach, to address the issue.
As will be shown, the advantage is that both the ‘with’ and
‘without’ poleward migration cases can be cleanly generated to
separate and quantify poleward migration’s effect on future TCs.
PI is TC’s intensity theoretical upper bound, given the thermal-
dynamic environmental conditions. Though PI is not the actual
intensity of TCs, it is the closest possible intensity estimate with
strong theoretical underpinning13,41. It has also been suggested to
be used as a proxy for the actual intensity as well13. Thus the
information provided is highly relevant, especially understanding
how PI may change in the future is by itself important.
Our study region is the Western North Pacific Ocean (WNP), as it
is among the global oceans where poleward migration is the most
evident, in both present-day observation as well as in future
projections30–40. The WNP is also the largest TC basin on earth:
60% of the world’s most intense TCs (i.e., Category-5 TCs) are
located in the WNP46,47.
Before proceeding, we first perform a latitude analysis to re-
examine the poleward migration over the WNP by the end of the
21st Century, to ensure that a robust poleward migration
projection exists. Three TC track groups are examined. The first
two groups are from the CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison
Project 5) explicitly-simulated TCs, under the Representative
Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 emission pathways, as
in Camargo 20135. The third group of tracks is from synthetic TCs
downscaled from the CMIP5 RCP 8.5 environmental fields, as in
Emanuel 20158. The first and the 2nd groups are named C-Track-
4.5, and C-Track-8.5, respectively, while the 3rd group is named E-
Track-8.5. Both C-Track-4.5 and C-Track-8.5 include 6 different
climate models, while E-Track-8.5 includes 7 models. Although
more models are included in Camargo 20135, some generate too
few TCs and their climatology is too different from observations,
therefore those models are excluded from analysis (Methods). All 7
models from Emanuel 20158 are considered here.
As we are interested in centennial trends, a 10-year low-pass
running filter is applied to remove high-frequency (e.g. inter-
annual) variability. Additional tests using 5-year and 20-year filters
are also conducted. We arrange the data according to each

Although prolonged heat periods have become a recurring feature of European climate, little knowledge is available on dominant
spatial patterns of heatwaves and their influence on moisture-related processes. Increased knowledge will help to improve
heatwave and drought prediction and mitigation. This study uses hierarchical agglomerative clustering to derive nine dominating
spatial heatwave patterns from a 50-member regional climate model (Canadian Regional Climate Model version 5, CRCM5-LE). The
heatwave patterns correspond well with clusters derived from an observational data set (E-OBS) and with extreme historical
heatwave events. Moreover, we analyse the occurrence of heatwaves in the identified spatial patterns regarding a soil moisture
deficit present before and after the event. We show that negative soil moisture anomalies in the preceding winter/spring (JFMA)
can serve as a predictor for heatwaves in South Europe. For North Europe, we find a negative correlation between the number of
heatwave days in summer and autumn (OND) soil moisture content.","INTRODUCTION
Heatwaves and droughts substantially impact human mortality,
economic well-being, infrastructure, and natural ecosystems1–3.
For example, the 2003 heatwave in Europe is estimated to have
caused more than 70,000 deaths4. Globally, 2% of working hours

Droughts
that
often
accompany a heatwave have been estimated to cause losses of
USD 621 Million on average per event between 1950 and 2014 in
Europe6. The 2010 heatwave in Russia caused USD 15 Billion (1%
gross domestic product) in total economic losses7. Since 1950,
most regions worldwide have observed a significant increase in
the number of heatwave days, maximum duration, and cumula-
tive heat8. Climate model projections estimate that the described
trends will continue throughout the 21st century9,10. There is a
high need for operational seasonal forecasts of heatwaves and
droughts to mitigate their impacts, e.g., to introduce measures for
water
saving
or
prepare
navigation
infrastructure
for
low
flows11,12. Current forecasts offer limited predictive capabilities,
underlining the importance of future studies to increase under-
standing of mechanisms causing the events13–15. Identifying
heatwave patterns allows a meaningful way of dimensionality
reduction, which is important for further research on driving
physical mechanisms for heatwave occurrence.
Current research highlights that heatwaves and droughts are
highly interrelated and caused by similar persistent large-scale
atmospheric
circulation
patterns16–18.
Moreover,
the
self-
intensifying nature of extreme droughts and heatwaves has been
suggested as central to their evolution19–21. There is a two-fold
relationship. On the one hand, soil and vegetation dry with the
occurrence of a heatwave, leading to reduced evaporation.
Therefore, the likelihood of rainfall decreases, favouring the
formation of drought20,22. On the other hand, evaporation
decreases with the onset of drought. The reduced cloud cover
leads to a larger fraction of solar radiation reaching the land
surface, increasing the likelihood of heatwave formation20,22.

The influence of precipitation and soil moisture anomalies on
heatwave formation has been studied in different European
regions. A rainfall deficit in the Mediterranean in spring is found to
favour the formation of heatwaves in Northern Europe as the
rainfall deficit propagates northward throughout the summer16,24.
A recent study17 confirmed that dry conditions in winter/spring
seasons prevail prior to hot summers over Southern Europe. Other
studies confirm that anomalously dry Western and Northern
European summers significantly correlate with the occurrence of
heatwaves
in
those
regions25.

extremes in South-Eastern Europe26,27. For the European heatwave
of July 2019, land-atmosphere feedback and influences of
northward propagation of dryness contributed to the exceptional
intensity of the event28.
Most research on heatwaves investigates historical events
based on observational data17,24,26,29, which rarely happen by
definition. Moreover, only few studies have analysed generalised
patterns of heatwaves to derive scientific findings applicable to
coherent regions24,29 instead of focusing on the causes of single
events30,31. By ’coherent regions’, we here and thereafter mean
regions connected to similar atmospheric circulation patterns,
such that the heatwaves occur simultaneously and over the same
geographical region. Large climate model ensembles have proven
their usefulness for the investigation of extreme events both in
terms of extreme cold and wet, as well as in terms of hot and dry
events32–36. They allow the assessment of the natural variability of
extreme weather events and therefore facilitate to derive of
statistically reliable findings.

As an internal forcing of the earth climate system, soil moisture (SM) significantly influences the water and energy cycle by
controlling evapotranspiration and terrestrial solar energy. The current study used observed precipitation, remotely sensed SM, and
reanalysis of atmosphere and land parameters to assess the East Asian Monsoon (EAM) precipitation variability due to meridional
SM oscillations across China. A generalized linear method, namely coupled manifold technique (CMT) for assessing the reciprocal
forcing between two climate fields and numerical simulations are applied to SM and EAM precipitation. We find that the EAM
precipitation interannual variability between north and south China significantly correlates with SM meridional oscillation. The CMT
results further showed that SM forcing has a significant (99% confidence) influence on the EAM precipitation explaining about 0.40
of the variance ratio in north and south China. The EAM and SM composite analysis show that the wetter (drier) north (south)
oscillates the EAM precipitation over the north (south) of China and vice versa due to SM thermal controls. We then used control
and sensitivity simulations with SM observations to further validate the findings implying that SM can potentially improve the
interannual EAM forecast skills. The model results show that a wetter (drier) north (south) results in negative (positive) sensible heat
(latent heat) anomalies that impact the boundary layer and propagate to change the meridional atmospheric heating profile. When
positive (negative) SM anomalies exist over northern (southern) China, the zonal easterlies and extratropical westerlies move to
north China causing above-normal precipitation that descends into southern China, suppressing subtropical westerlies and
precipitation in southern China. On the contrary, a dry (wet) north (south) favors intensified subtropical westerlies and precipitation
in southern China. The findings have dire implications for the water and energy cycle of the region in the projected wetting and
drying patterns of the north (south).","INTRODUCTION
The complex structure of the East Asian Monsoon (EAM) precipitation
extremes poses direct threats to China’s regional economy and Gross
Domestic Product (GDP). The EAM complexity lies within its drivers,
which consist of internal feedback between different components of
the earth’s climate system, including land1–3, atmosphere4,5, Ocean6,
and cryosphere7,8. The interannual variability of the EAM could be
understood as a direct space-time precipitation variation between
(within) the northern and southern major river basins of China forced
by these factors. The anomalous modes of these driving factors
influence the precipitation extremes that produce floods, droughts,
and heatwaves with profound socioeconomic impacts9. The severity,
frequency, and intensity of floods and droughts may amplify the
regional losses to $60 billion in capital and many folds attributed to
drought under 1.5 and 2 °C warmings6,10,11. The historical EAM
precipitation-induced flooding during 1984–2018 cost $19.2 billion,
accounting for 0.5% of the national GDP and 54% of total weather-
related losses, with an exponential increase from 2006-onward,
accounting for $25.3 billion10. In >1.5 °C warming of the climate, the
EAM may intensify primarily due to enhanced land-sea thermal
contrast favoring increased continental precipitation12,13. The pro-
jected increase in the mean and frequency of the precipitation
extremes makes the EAM domain one of the extreme flood-prone
regions later in the twenty-first century10,14.
The
coherent
monsoon
variability
and
its
quantitative
response to the earth system’s internal and external feedback
have been an ongoing research topic in recent decades15,16. The
global
monsoon
system
functions
as
a
three-dimensional
planetary-scale circulation primarily driven by solar insolation
as an external forcing oscillating precipitation band across
hemispheres17. The internal forcing and feedback within the
earth spheres further drive the monsoon’s spatial distribution
and shape, including the ocean’s coupled processes, overlying
atmosphere, and land-sea distribution18,19. These forcing alto-
gether result in coupled processes and modes influencing
monsoon characteristics from synoptic to mesoscale, including
the onset, advance, and retreat20,21. Past efforts have highlighted
multiple dimensions of EAM, including its onset22, meridional
oscillations23,24, and regional flooding/droughts6 due to interac-
tions
(modes)
of
the
land-atmosphere
and
ocean
nexus
(processes). The EAM characteristics described above are shaped
by these coupled modes within the earth system, benefiting the
forecast and prediction skills. Zhou et al. (2021) reported the
mediating role of SST in offsetting the spring SM influence of
summer EAM precipitation with decreased precipitation under
positive SST background and vice versa for negative SST, further
reducing the spatial spread of precipitation anomalies1. Lv et al.
(2019) reported an increase in the maximum daily precipitation
during the Eastern Pacific El Niño and Central Pacific El Niño

Understanding the inter-basin interactions between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans is of great concern due to their substantial
global climatic implications. By analyzing observational reanalysis datasets (1948–2020), we found that there are two regimes in
Atlantic–Pacific inter-basin interactions: (1) the Pacific-driven regime, and (2) the Atlantic-driven regime. In the Pacific-driven regime
before the mid-1980s, the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in winter effectively drives the primary mode of sea surface
temperature anomaly (SSTA) in the tropical Atlantic (i.e., North Tropical Atlantic (NTA) mode) in the following spring. The NTA mode
has a meridional contrast of SSTA along the Atlantic Intertropical Convergence Zone, similar to the Atlantic Meridional Mode.
Whereas, in the Atlantic-driven regime after the mid-1980s, the ENSO effect on the NTA becomes remarkably weaker, so that the
NTA mode is featured with a SSTA monopole. Notably, the NTA mode without the meridional contrast of SSTA is capable of
modulating an ENSO event with a lag. Our analyses of the latest climate models participating in the Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project (CMIP) phases 6 support the hypothesis that the two regimes engendered by the Atlantic–Pacific inter-
basin interactions are likely due to natural variability.","INTRODUCTION
One important climatic phenomenon that needs to be better
understood is the inter-basin interactions in Earth’s two largest
oceans, the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, which have enormous
impacts on various climate and weather phenomena world-
wide1–4. Much attention has been paid to the interactions
between the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans, which is crucial for
improving the credibility of climate change projections and their
associated global impacts5–8. The Atlantic–Pacific inter-basin
interactions can be specified according to their different time-
scales. On decadal to interdecadal timescales, Pacific warming
(cooling) is able to induce Atlantic warming (warming), whereas
Atlantic warming (cooling) possibly causes Pacific cooling (warm-
ing)7–11. On interannual timescales, the El Niño–Southern Oscilla-
tion (ENSO) modulates sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs)
in the North Tropical Atlantic (NTA) in the following spring to
summer via extratropical and tropical atmospheric teleconnec-
tions12–17. In contrast, the SST variability in the NTA can also
modulate an ENSO event in the subsequent boreal winter by
altering anomalous low-level zonal winds over the equatorial
western Pacific via atmospheric teleconnections18–21.
The Atlantic–Pacific inter-basin interactions on decadal time-
scales have been well examined, but those on interannual
timescales have not been investigated thoroughly, particularly
non-stationary perspectives and their causes. Recent studies have
shown that the impact of NTA on the ENSO has become significant
since the mid-1980s17,21,22, as the climatological mean SST in the
tropical Atlantic has increased as a result of a positive phase shift of
the
Atlantic
Multi-decadal
Oscillation
or/and
anthropogenic
warming22,23. The warmer climatological mean SST in the tropical
Atlantic promotes an atmospheric response to the SSTA variation,
causing an enhanced NTA-ENSO connection. In contrast, the ENSO
impact on NTA has weakened since the mid-1980s17,24.
Therefore, we infer that there are likely two regimes in the
Atlantic–Pacific inter-basin interactions on interannual timescales,
which has been less examined previously. Understanding the
physical mechanisms of the two regimes would help to improve
the reliability of climate variability projection in the present-day and
future climate. In this study, we examine the physical processes
associated with two distinct regimes in the Atlantic–Pacific inter-
basin interactions on interannual timescales by analyzing observa-
tional datasets and climate models.
RESULTS

Soil moisture (SM) plays a crucial role in altering climate extremes through complex land-atmosphere feedback processes. In the
present study, we investigated the impact of SM perturbations on temperature extremes (ExT) over India for the historical period
(1951–2010) and future climate projection (2051–2100) under 4 K warming scenario. We note that more than 70% area of the
Indian landmass has experienced significant changes in characteristics of ExT due to SM perturbations. In particular, we see larger
impact of SM perturbations on ExT over the north-central India (NCI), which is a hotspot of strong SM-temperature coupling. Over
NCI, a 20% departure in SM significantly revamps frequency, duration and intensity of ExT by 2–5 events/year, 1-2 days/event and
0.5–2.1 °C, respectively, through modulating surface energy partitioning, evapotranspiration and SM memory. Importantly, the
impact of SM perturbations on frequency and duration of ExT events becomes less prominent with intensification of global
warming.","INTRODUCTION
Major land regions of the world have been exhibiting severe rise
in temperature extremes (ExT) during the recent few decades1.
The Indian subcontinent has been highlighted as one of the
hotspots for increased characteristics of ExT2,3. Recent studies
have projected that outbreak of high-intensity ExT is likely to
become more common over India at the end of the 21st
century4–8. The Indian region generally experienced the extreme
heat conditions during the pre-monsoon months of April-May-
June9,10, which may elongate into the summer monsoon season as
well, due to prolonged deficiency of the monsoon rainfall11–13.
Furthermore, increase in ExT exerts serious impact on the
ecosystem, human health, agriculture and economy14,15.
Understanding long-term changes in ExT over India in past and
future climate has been an important topic of research12,14,15.
Observations indicate that occurrence of ExT over India is linked to
large-scale atmospheric circulation anomalies and regional-scale
land-atmosphere feedback processes arising from soil moisture
(SM) variations16–19. In particular, SM revamps the ExT by
modulating the surface energy partitioning and evapotranspira-
tion (ET)13,20,21. As a crucial component of land-atmosphere
coupling processes, SM also acts as temporal storage of atmo-
spheric anomalies22–25. Additionally, the long-term persisting
nature (memory) of SM has potential to induce a pronounce
impact
on
near-surface
temperature
and
precipitation
(PR)
variability13,26. Therefore, it is very important to understand the
regional-scale SM variability using observational datasets and
model simulations to get better insight into land-atmosphere
feedback
processes
associated
with
extreme
temperature
conditions13,20,27,28.
The influence of SM on ExT can be determined using the
observational data products13,17,29 as well as state-of-the-art
climate model sensitivity experiments initialized by perturbing
SM30,31. In review of the SM sensitivity experiments over the
Indian landmass, researchers mostly explored SM-PR feedback
mechanism using the model simulations32–34. However, impact of
SM perturbations on ExT over India is still unclear. Therefore, this
study aims to investigate the impact of SM perturbations on ExT
by using the Meteorological Research Institute (MRI) high-
resolution (~60 km) atmospheric general circulation model (i.e.
MRI-AGCM3.235) simulations (refer to sub-section Model and
experimental setups for more details) for the historical period
(1951–2010) and future projection (2051–2100).
RESULTS
Model evaluation
In this section, we will first evaluate the simulation of some of the
key surface hydro-meteorological variables (PR, SM, ET, and
maximum temperature: Tmax) over the Indian region from the
historical (HIST) experiment with respect to observed datasets.
Time-mean (1951–2010) spatial maps of PR, Tmax, SM and ET are
shown in Fig. 1 from the HIST experiment (1st row) and
observational data products (2nd row). While the model simulation
broadly captures the spatial pattern of annual mean PR, SM and
ET, such as the relatively higher values over the west coast, north-
central and north-eastern parts of India and lower values over the
north-west India, there are also noteworthy differences between
the simulated and observed hydro-meteorological variables. For
example, it can be seen that the simulation indicates drier PR,
lower ET and drier SM over the Indo-Gangetic plains as compared
to observations. We also note that the simulated annual mean
Tmax is underestimated over much of the Indian region as
compared to the observed data.
Model biases at regional and sub-regional scales basically arise
due to differences in statistical properties of the simulated and
observed climatic variables (e.g., PR and Tmax), which need to be
taken into account for model evaluations (see Soriano et al.36).
Keeping this in view, we have applied the bias correction method

The reversibility of South Asian summer monsoon (SASM) precipitation under the CO2 removal scenario is critical for climate
mitigation and adaptation. In the idealized CO2 ramp-up (from 284.7 to 1138.8 ppm) and symmetric ramp-down experiments, SASM
precipitation is largely reversible while exhibiting strong asymmetry: it may overshoot the unperturbed level when CO2 recovers.
Such asymmetric response is mainly due to the enhanced El Niño-like and Indian Ocean dipole-like warming during the ramp-down
period. The uneven sea surface warming weakens Walker circulation, with anomalous sinking over the SASM region. Meanwhile, the
warming also affects the rainfall over the Maritime Continent and tropical western Indian Ocean. The suppressed rainfall over the
Maritime Continent triggers the equatorial Rossby wave, which weakens the ascent over the SASM region; the increased rainfall
over the tropical western Indian Ocean excites the equatorial Kelvin wave, which reduces moisture transport. Additionally, tropic-
wide warming reduces the land-sea thermal contrast and weakens monsoonal circulation. Consequently, the combined effects of
the weakened ascent and moisture transport lead to the overshooting of SASM rainfall. Our results suggest that symmetric CO2
removal, although unlikely in the foreseeable future, may result in a risk of local drought over the SASM region.","INTRODUCTION
The concentration of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere has
been increasing since the Industrial Revolution. It exerts severe,
widespread, and irreversible influences on climate and human
society1. To avoid or lower these influences, the Paris Agreement
proposed a strict target, i.e., holding the increase in the global
average temperature to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial (PI)
level and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to
1.5 °C above PI. Such long-term temperature goals call for
reaching the global peak of greenhouse gas emissions as soon
as possible to achieve a climate-neutral world by the middle of the
21st century. Achieving this target requires Carbon Dioxide
Removal (CDR) methods to decrease atmospheric CO2 concentra-
tion in the future1–6. Due to its huge heat capacity, the ocean acts
as heat storage which absorbs most of the redundant energy
arising from the CO2 concentration increases1,7. In particular, the
response of the ocean is much slower, with a timescale of decades
to millennia8–10. If CDR methods are applied, the excess heat
accumulated in the ocean would affect the climate response
during the CO2 ramp-down period11–13. At present, the climate
effect of CDR is still inconsistent and inadequately understood in
the scientific community14,15.
The South Asian summer monsoon (SASM), a crucial compo-
nent of the global monsoon system, directly affects the lives of
more than one billion people. Slight changes in SASM precipita-
tion can cause tremendous socioeconomic impacts, including
impacts on agricultural production, water resources, and basic
human needs16,17. Hence, understanding the response of SASM
precipitation to climate change is of great importance. Under a
global warming scenario where the CO2 concentration increases
monotonically, SASM precipitation is projected to increase in
nearly all models, despite a weakening of SASM circulation18,19.
Previous studies have reported that enhanced atmospheric water
vapor content and the larger moisture convergence into the SASM
region20–23 are responsible for the increased rainfall, which is
consistent with the “wet-get-wetter” mechanism24–26. However,
the positive contribution of the thermodynamic effect is partially
offset by the dynamic effect due to the weakened circulation,
which results in a lower increase in SASM precipitation than water
vapor content27,28. The enhanced upper-tropospheric warming
over the tropical Indian Ocean29, as well as the mean advection of
the stratification change mechanism30, may all contribute to the
weakened SASM circulation.
Under the CDR scenario, SASM precipitation displays an
overshooting relative to that during the CO2 ramp-up period31,
namely, SASM precipitation may fully recover and exhibit
drought when the CO2 concentration recovers. This is signifi-
cantly
different
from
that
of
the
global
hydrological
cycle12,13,32–35. In the idealized experiment in which the CO2 rise
is followed by a symmetric decline, global precipitation continues
to rise for decades after CO2 peaks and cannot return to the
initial level when CO2 recovers. Such an asymmetric response of
global precipitation originates mainly from the ocean, and
precipitation on land is nearly symmetrical11,36. The response of
rainfall at the regional scale has a similar response to global
precipitation, including the Intertropical Convergence Zone
(ITCZ)37, East Asia34, and the Korean Peninsula35. For example,
the location of the ITCZ changes minimally during the CO2 ramp-
up period; in contrast, it shifts rapidly to the south during the CO2
ramp-down period and resides in the south when the CO2
concentration recovers to the initial level, leading to the
asymmetric
responses
of
the
ITCZ-related
precipitation37.

Extreme summer temperatures are increasingly common across the Northern Hemisphere and inflict severe socioeconomic and
biological consequences. In summer 2021, the Pacific Northwest region of North America (PNW) experienced a 2-week-long
extreme heatwave, which contributed to record-breaking summer temperatures. Here, we use tree-ring records to show that
summer temperatures in 2021, as well as the rate of summertime warming during the last several decades, are unprecedented
within the context of the last millennium for the PNW. In the absence of committed efforts to curtail anthropogenic emissions
below intermediate levels (SSP2–4.5), climate model projections indicate a rapidly increasing risk of the PNW regularly experiencing
2021-like extreme summer temperatures, with a 50% chance of yearly occurrence by 2050. The 2021 summer temperatures
experienced across the PNW provide a benchmark and impetus for communities in historically temperate climates to account for
extreme heat-related impacts in climate change adaptation strategies.","INTRODUCTION
Surface air temperatures and the frequency and intensity of
extreme heat events are increasing globally and are consequences
of anthropogenic climate change1–5. The latest Intergovernmental
Panel on Climatic Change (IPCC) consensus reports that global
mean temperatures over the first two decades of the 21st century
were
0.99
(0.84–1.10)
°C
higher
than
pre-Industrial
levels
(1850–1900 CE), and they are projected to exceed 1.5 °C above
pre-Industrial levels by 20406. In particular, the last two decades
show a substantial increase in extreme summer temperatures
worldwide7–12. Understanding the spatial and temporal variations
in the magnitude of these trends is critical because of the intrinsic
coupling between climate extremes and ecological and socio-
economic systems.
In the summer of 2021, the Pacific Northwest region of the
United States (US) and southwest Canada (hereafter the Pacific
Northwest; PNW; 42–53 °N, 115–124 °W) experienced a prolonged,
record-breaking heatwave starting in late June and continuing
through early July. This extreme event was associated with an
omega block atmospheric pattern that focused warmth over the
PNW and caused daytime temperatures to reach 49.6 °C, increased
wildfire activity13, elevated rates of heat-related deaths among
PNW
communities14,
and
ranks
among
one
of
the
most
anomalous, extreme heat events ever recorded globally during
the observation period15. While the event lasted several weeks,
the imprint of these extreme conditions is also apparent at longer
timescales. In 2021, the PNW also experienced the highest mean
summer (June-August; JJA) near-surface air temperatures on
record over the observation period (1950–2021) (Fig. 1). Based
on ERA5 reanalysis data, summer 2021 was approximately +3.6 °C
warmer than the 1951–1980 average.
Extreme temperatures are some of the most significant climate
impacts that human populations currently experience6, but
communities around the world have different levels of vulner-
ability and resilience to the consequences of climate change16,17.
The timing and location of the PNW heatwave are particularly
alarming, because none
of the
natural, socioeconomic,
or
infrastructural systems of the normally temperate PNW climate
are currently adapted to prolonged extreme warmth. The
inadequate regional infrastructure reflects a social perception
that extreme warmth is not a substantial threat in this region of
North America18. Prolonged heatwaves often go unrecognized as
serious community health threats in temperate locations19, but
when they do occur, indoor facilities are unable to provide heat
relief for the most vulnerable populations. Compared to the US
national average, significantly less homes in the PNW have
primary air conditioning (AC)20. While rates of AC use in British
Columbia, Canada have nearly doubled in the last decade, as of
2020, still less than 40% of British Colombians have centralized
household AC21, indicating a persistent vulnerability to warm
temperature extremes. In addition to the immediate societal and
health consequences, the effects of sustained temperature stress
on forest ecosystems are visible across much of the PNW22,23.
A growing body of literature, using limited observational data
and modeling to characterize the historic nature of the 2021 PNW
summer conditions, shows this event to be highly anomalous and
of a magnitude with no comparable modern climatic analog24,25.
Rapid attribution suggests that the occurrence of this event would
have been virtually impossible without anthropogenic climate
change, but because the observed extreme temperatures were so
far outside the range of historically observed temperatures (since
ca. 1895), it is difficult to confidently quantify the rarity of the
event24. Augmenting the observational record with proxy data can

dispersion and deposition dynamics of bioaerosols around a vaccine factory were numerically investigated under various thermal
conditions and leakage rates. To assess infection risk at the pedestrian level, the improved Wells-Riley equation was used. To predict
the evacuation path, Dijkstra’s algorithm, a derived greedy algorithm based on the improved Wells-Riley equation, was applied. The
results show that, driven by buoyancy force, the deposition of bioaerosols can reach 80 m on the windward sidewall of high-rise
buildings. Compared with stable thermal stratification, the infection risk of unstable thermal stratification in the upstream portion of
the study area can increase by 5.53% and 9.92% under a low and high leakage rate, respectively. A greater leakage rate leads to
higher infection risk but a similar distribution of high-risk regions. The present work provides a promising approach for infection risk
assessment and evacuation planning for the emergency response to urban bioaerosol leakage.","INTRODUCTION
Urban areas are where wealth and economies are concentrated,
but they are also densely populated1. In the context of the
COVID-19
pandemic,

(BPs)
is
no
longer
limited
to
indoor
transmission, and mounting studies now focus on outdoor
infections
among
urban
residents
by
considering
various
transmission pathways of contagious BPs. For instance, residents
were reported to have contracted COVID-19 from the air while
farming
outdoors
(
content_41937765.html, in Chinese). In 2019, BPs that were not
completely inactivated due to expired disinfectant water were
accidently released from a vaccine factory in Lanzhou, China,
resulting in the spread of active Brucella virus aerosols into
nearby urban areas. Consequently, a biosafety incident occurred,
leaving many people infected with the Brucella virus including
the students in the research institute 400 m away as well as
residents in the surrounding areas (
art/2020/9/15/art_4531_928158.html, in Chinese). In addition,
the United States and many other countries have also incurred
terrorist and Bacillus anthracis attacks in their urban cities2.
Evidently, urban areas with their crowded populations and
complex geographic topology are at high risk of virus transmis-
sion and unexpected infection. In particular, a formidable
challenge lies in predicting and responding to the short-term,
large-scale transmission of infectious BPs released from vaccine
factories, wastewater plants, or livestock farms.
Generally, computation fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation has
been widely applied in research on urban building ventilation and
pollutant dispersion, with wind tunnel experiments used to
validate the simulation results3,4. Compared with Gaussian and
integral models, an advantage to using CFD is that it can account
for various meteorological conditions, chemical reactions, and
complex urban environments5,6. It is proven that the aerodynamic
behavior of airborne bioaerosols particles (organic or not) around
building complexes can be well represented via either the
Reynolds-averaged-Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulation approach or
Large Eddy Simulations (LES)7–9. In particular, the flow fields
operating at a urban scale can be reliably expressed by RANS
simulations with a low consumption of computation power and
reasonable
accuracy
in
resolving
turbulence7,10–12.
For
the
modeling of a pollutant, both Euler and Lagrangian discrete
phase models have been widely applied, but they often yield
different results in terms of its dynamic concentration13. An
idealized urban model was built and numerically simulated using
the Euler model to investigate urban ventilation and pollutant
dispersion under different building densities and aspect ratios14.
In other work, a tracer gas was used to replicate the process of a
virus leaking from a ventilation shaft and spreading into an
adjacent tall building15. The simulation results obtained via the
Euler model are capable of incorporating well the real exposure
risks between the adjacent tall buildings. Yet, because there exists
an interaction force between particles and air, particles could also
affect the flow field to a certain extent. Meanwhile, the deposition
of particles on the surfaces of certain buildings should not be
neglected, especially when an outdoor-to-indoor transmission is
possible. Accordingly, the Lagrangian particle-tracking model,
which can fully consider the air-particle coupling and track particle
deposition, is typically preferred for studying the movement of
smoke or BPs. Further, by combining RANS with the Lagrangian
particle-tracking model, the rapid prediction of a pollutant’s
dispersion and deposition with reasonable accuracy can be
obtained,
enabling
a
quicker

incidents.
Unlike most other pollutants, however, the transmission of toxic
BPs is contagious and pathogenic. Normally, BPs are composed of
dust, microorganisms, and microbial debris whose par

The Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) has profound impacts on weather and climate phenomena, and thus changes in its activity
have important implications under human-induced global climate change. Here, the time at which the MJO change signal emerges
from natural variability under anthropogenic warming is investigated. Using simulations of the Community Earth System Model
version 2 large ensemble forced by the shared socioeconomic pathways SSP370 scenario, an increase in ensemble mean MJO
precipitation amplitude and a smaller increase in MJO circulation amplitude occur by the end of the 21st century, consistent with
previous studies. Notably, the MJO precipitation amplitude change signal generally emerges more than a decade earlier than that
of MJO wind amplitude. MJO amplitude changes also emerge earlier over the eastern Pacific than other parts of the tropics. Our
findings provide valuable information on the potential changes of MJO variability with the aim of improving predictions of the MJO
and its associated extreme events.","INTRODUCTION
The Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) is the dominant source of
intraseasonal variability in the tropics1–4 and has profound
impacts on weather and climate. MJO activity can modulate
tropical-extratropical interactions and extreme events in the
extratropics5,6, tropical cyclone genesis7, and cooling trends in
the Antarctic8, among many impacts. Previous work has shown
that MJO precipitation amplitude can increase, decrease, or
remain little changed in climate change simulations, depending
on competing effects of an increased lower tropospheric moisture
gradient and more top-heavy MJO diabatic heating profile9. In
contrast, the change in MJO circulation amplitude is projected to
weaken or increase at a slower rate than MJO precipitation
amplitude10. Increases in MJO precipitation amplitude have been
found in aquaplanet models11, single climate models12,13, multi-
model analyses from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
(CMIP) phase 3/5/610,14,15, and also observations16. Projected
increases in MJO precipitation and weakening or slower increases
of MJO wind anomaly amplitude with warming are consistent with
increases in dry tropical static stability, which are proportional to
increases in tropical sea surface temperature (SST)17. Readers are
referred to Maloney et al.18 for more discussion about MJO
changes under anthropogenic warming.
Although future changes in the MJO amplitude in response to
global warming are likely, it remains unclear when and how these
anthropogenic signals will emerge out of the background noise of
natural variability. By analyzing the spread derived from a group of
CMIP5 models, Bui and Maloney (2019b) noted that individual
changes in multimodel mean MJO precipitation and circulation
amplitude are only detectable late in the 21st century17. Before
then, internal climate variability associated with decadal/inter-
decadal climate variations prevents the attribution of MJO change
signals to greenhouse gas forcing. However, the authors also
argued that decreases in the ratio of MJO wind to precipitation
anomaly amplitude can be detected as early as 2021–2040,
controlled by increases in dry tropical static stability with warming.
Jenney et al. (2021) added that multi-model uncertainty, which
may come from the uncertainty in the parameterized moist
physics in the model as mentioned by Rushley et al. (2019), also
contributes to the uncertainty in future detection of the MJO
characteristics19,20. In addition to the model results above,
observational evidence also suggest that detecting MJO changes
is complicated by interannual-to-multidecadal climate variations
in the past few decades16,21.
Given the challenges in assessing MJO changes in the presence
of natural variability in the climate system, we will define an index
that isolates the global warming signal on the MJO from the
impacts of internal climate variability. Our method is closely
related to the concept of time of emergence (ToE), the time when
changes in a quantity in response to anthropogenic greenhouse
gas emissions deviate from natural variability22–26. Using this
concept, Mora et al. (2013) showed that mean SST change signals
emerge earlier in a business-as-usual scenario than a stabilization
scenario, and unprecedented climates show the earliest emer-
gence in the tropics regardless of scenario24. On interannual
timescales, Ying et al. (2022) reported that changes in El Niño/
Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-related rainfall variability are pro-
jected to emerge by the mid-21st century, earlier than the
emergence of ENSO-related SST variability26. On weather time-
scales, Sippel et al. (2020) suggested that the fingerprint of climate
change can be detected in the observed record of temperature
since early 2012 and this detection is robust even when ignoring
the long-term global warming trend25. However, on intraseasonal
timescales, timing of the emergence of MJO-related change
signals has received less emphasis, possibly because of com

In recent decades, the interior regions of Eurasia and North America have experienced several unprecedentedly cold winters
despite the global surface air temperature increases. One possible explanation of these increasing extreme cold winters comes from
the so-called Warm Arctic Cold Continent (WACC) pattern, reflecting the effects of the amplified Arctic warming in driving the
circulation change over surrounding continents. This study analyzed reanalysis data and model experiments forced by different
levels of anthropogenic forcing. It is found that WACC exists on synoptic scales in observations, model’s historical and even future
runs. In the future, the analysis suggests a continued presence of WACC but with a slightly weakened cold extreme due to the
overall warming. Warm Arctic events under the warmer climate will be associated with not only a colder continent in East Asia but
also a warmer continent, depending on the teleconnection process that is also complicated by the warmer Arctic. Such an
increasingly association suggests a reduction in potential predictability of the midlatitude winter anomalies.","INTRODUCTION
In recent decades, the Arctic region has warmed about twice as
fast as the rest of the globe1. Known as Arctic amplification (AA),
this phenomenon is associated with the reduced sea ice and the
increased surface air and ocean temperatures in the Arctic
throughout the year2–4. Meanwhile, extreme cold winters in the
midlatitudes have become more frequent, hence creating the
phenomenon known as the warm Arctic cold continent (WACC).
The subject of WACC has attracted a lot of research attention as it
provides
a
plausible
explanation
for
the
intensification
of
wintertime cold extremes5.
In the WACC framework, a fast decline of sea ice and an increase
in winter SST in the Barents-Kara (BK) Sea is significantly correlated
with a colder-than-usual winter climate in Eurasia. In contrast, a
warmer east Siberian-Chukchi (ESC) Sea with less sea ice coverage is
associated with abnormally cold winters in North America6. Various
dynamical pathways have been proposed to explain these
connections embedded in the intraseasonal time scales, including
the weakening of the stratospheric polar vortex7, rapid Arctic
tropospheric warming8, triggering of mid-tropospheric planetary
waves along the midlatitudes and enhanced blocking in Ural
regions9–11. All these dynamical pathways are thought to have
caused
the
midlatitude
winter
climate
to
become
more
extreme12,13. Recent studies suggested that the formation of WACC
is complex and difficult to attribute, since a wavier pattern of the jet
can be entirely caused by the atmospheric internal variability,
undermining the effect of AA14–20. Despite the ongoing debate, a
better understanding of WACC can improve the seasonal prediction
of high-latitude climate, considering the importance of this mode in
shaping weather and climate extremes in these regions.
This paper builds on the observed linkage between the Arctic and
mid-latitude regions on synoptic scales over the past decades. It
explores its historical and projected changes under current and 1.5-
and 2.0-degrees warming scenarios as determined by the Paris
Agreement as the critical threshold to limit the strength of global
warming. We analyze the Half degree additional warming, prognosis
and projected impacts (HAPPI), a relatively new model projection
dataset that has an advantage in assessing the impacts of 1.5- and
2.0-degrees warming on the world’s weather21. Through this analysis,
we assessed how WACC will vary through the synoptic linkage under
different global warming scenarios, as well as identifying what the
leading factor is in determining the dynamical changes.
RESULTS
Arctic-midlatitude relationships in observations
To establish the baseline for the association between the
midlatitude and Arctic synoptic activities, we followed Kug et al.
(2015) to examine the WACC patterns by conducting the
regression analysis in two regions: BK Sea with East Asia and
ESC Sea with North America. The regression coefficient between
the BK (ESC) Sea and East Asia (North America) for each winter is
shown as a time series in Fig. 1c, d. We also compute the
geographical distribution of the average regression coefficients as
regression maps (Fig. 1a, b): First, the winter-mean regression map
is shown in the middle of Fig. 1 (1979~2018). Second, we display a
few special winters: 1997/98 and 1991/92 were well-established
warm Arctic and cold continent patterns, while 2017/18 and 2004/
05 represent the warm Arctic and warm continent patterns.
Next, we examine the daily/synoptic weather fluctuation and
how their supposed association may change over a longer period
and in the future. In East Asia, most years show the negative
regression coefficient of 850hPa temperature anomalies concern-
ing the BK Sea (Fig. 1a, c). North America features a negative
regression coefficient for the ESC Sea in most years (Fig. 1b, d). The
negative regression coefficients between the Arctic and the

Heatwaves are one of the leading causes of climate-induced mortality. Using the examples of recent heatwaves in Europe, the
United States and Asia, we illustrate how the communication of dangerous conditions based on temperature maps alone can lead
to insufficient societal perception of health risks. Comparison of maximum daily values of temperature with physiological heat
stress indices accounting for impacts of both temperature and humidity, illustrates substantial differences in geographical extent
and timing of their respective peak values during these recent events. This signals the need to revisit how meteorological
heatwaves and their expected impacts are communicated. Close collaboration between climate and medical communities is
needed to select the best heat stress indicators, establish them operationally, and introduce them to the public.","INTRODUCTION
Heatwaves are typically defined as rare or unusually warm events
for a given location and time of year, that exceed a specific
temperature threshold for several consecutive days. The threshold
that would classify a meteorological event as an extreme
heatwave is therefore location-specific and varies around the
globe. Due to climate change, thresholds for extreme temperature
events are being redefined: for example, in 2022, the UK Met
Office switched to using warmer 1991–2020 climatology for
defining extreme temperature departures1. While the regional
thresholds for classifying an event as an extreme heatwave are
becoming higher, the human body’s physical thresholds of
tolerance to heat remain constant (i.e. there has been no evidence
of a recent evolutionary adaptation that would allow humans to
withstand or survive higher heat stress levels than before).
From ‘climate’ and ‘epidemiological’ perspectives, heatwaves
are most commonly investigated using near-surface air tempera-
ture, also referred to as dry-bulb temperature. Traditionally,
climate studies investigating future changes in extreme heat-
waves used projections of maximum daily temperatures2–7,
deriving various statistical indicators related to the magnitude,
frequency or duration of the temperature-defined heatwaves.
Likewise, meteorological maps used by the media to commu-
nicate forthcoming and ongoing heatwaves most commonly show
the
expected
sub-daily
or
daily
maximum
temperatures8,9.
Epidemiological studies investigating the links between the
heatwaves and mortality use the near-surface air temperature as
the key climate predictor for explaining heat-related outcomes10.
From a physiological perspective, however, changes in tempera-
ture alone are not considered sufficient to explain the stress that a
given extreme warm weather event can exert on the human body.
This is because meteorological factors like the humidity of the
surrounding air, the prevailing wind conditions and the length of
previous thermal exposure can all have a large impact on how a
given heatwave affects human health and the dangers it is likely
to pose. For example, an air temperature of 37 °C can be perceived
as uncomfortable for humans in low humidity, but in combination
with high humidity and no wind, it creates conditions under which
the human body cannot cool down, thereby potentially posing
detrimental health risks.
With
the
aim
of
relating
the
impact
of
meteorological
conditions on the human body and defining the limits dangerous
for human health, the climate - health community has focused on
the development of a number of heat-stress indices – humidex
(Hu), apparent temperature (AT), wet bulb globe temperature
(WBGT), heat index (HI) and universal thermal climate index (UTCI),
amongst others - that incorporate the impacts of several
meteorological variables (most notably humidity) in their assess-
ment of associated health risks11–13. However, one of the major
difficulties in characterizing dangerous heatwave conditions arises
from the fact that it is not possible to conduct controlled
experiments on a wider population that would investigate the
onset of the most dangerous health outcomes under extreme
heat conditions. The scientific community has thus often had to
rely on using actual heatwave occurrences to try to extract such
information14. Critical thresholds have also been suggested based
on
the
laws
of
physics.
For
example,
at
35 °C
wet-bulb
temperature (WBT), evaporation is not possible and cooling
through sweating would not be effective, leading to the
suggestion that this is the upper threshold for human survival in
humid heat15. However, a recent study that carried out several
controlled experiments on human response to heat concluded
that a physics-only definition leads to a substantial overestimation
of human health thresholds. Actual monitoring of heat stress
levels in human subjects has shown that the human body can
start to experience serious strain at 28

Pastoralism in Old World savannas is known to emit a significant share of global livestock-sourced greenhouse gases (GHG). Here,
we compare calculated emissions from animals in a wildlife-dominated savanna (14.3 Mg km−2), to those in an adjacent land with
similar ecological characteristics but under pastoralism (12.8 Mg km−2). The similar estimates for both, wildlife and pastoralism
(76.2 vs 76.5 Mg CO2-eq km−2), point out an intrinsic association of emissions with herbivore ecological niches. Considering natural
baseline or natural background emissions in grazing systems has important implications in the analysis of global food systems.","INTRODUCTION
Livestock-mediated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are consid-
ered a large causative agent of climate change, with up to 3.75 Gt
CO2-eq emitted yearly1. A large part of them is attributed to low-
input livestock systems in regions with vast savanna landscapes,
with Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia specifically accounting for
0.68 (18% of livestock GHG) and 0.73 (20% of livestock GHG) Gt
CO2-eq, respectively1.
Natural rangelands, including savannas, store large amounts of
soil carbon and have the capacity to act as carbon sinks,
especially when restored from degraded states. However, the
current emissions attributed to livestock are considered to exceed
the mitigation capacity of rangeland soils2. The bulk of direct GHG
emissions attributed to livestock consists of methane (CH4)
produced during the enteric fermentation in the rumen and
CH4 and nitrous oxide (N2O) released by manure, so that grazing
livestock is considered an intense GHG emitter3. Following the
identification of CH4 as a good target for quick and effective
climate action, more than 100 countries agreed to drastically
reduce emissions at the recent UN Climate Change Conference
(COP26) in Glasgow4. Such policy guidelines inevitably lead to
recommending the abandonment of livestock grazing in vast
rangeland areas, which would be subjected to rewilding5, both
for the assumed potential of reduction in CH4 emissions and for
the potential sequestration of carbon once herbivory is drastically
reduced6. These calls are not exclusive to high-income countries
but extend to countries with very significant livestock popula-
tions, most notably India—the largest livestock CH4 emitter
worldwide1—where the abandonment of traditional animal
husbandry is proposed7.
Grazing livestock and wild herbivores occupy similar ecologi-
cal niches, raising the question whether abandonment of
pastoralism would necessarily lead to a significant reduction of
emissions8. Large herbivores attain biomass densities in wild or
rewilded landscapes that are particularly high in Sub-Saharan
Africa and, to a lesser extent, South and South-East Asia9. There,
unlike in other areas, guilds of large herbivores have been
preserved up to the present. Recolonization of abandoned
rangelands by large herbivores is thus likely to reach very high
densities10, and such wild fauna can potentially attain high levels
of GHG emissions8. In order to check for the relevance of this
process of herbivore substitution, the hypothesis needs to be
tested with current field data comparing analog ecosystems
grazed by livestock and wildlife.
In this study, we aimed to analyze the scenario of a tropical
savanna landscape where grazing livestock has dominated for
many decades11, but which has the potential to be rapidly
recolonized by wild herbivores in the case of abandonment. To
examine the contribution to global warming from animals in
wildlife-dominated
vs.
livestock-dominated
landscapes,
we
selected two adjacent areas in Northern Tanzania (Fig. 1) for
which enough data are available to establish a comparison. We
calculated the GHG emissions per unit area in the Serengeti-
Mara ecosystem, a large, 25,000 km2 wilderness area dominated
by migratory wildebeest as grazers and elephants as browsers.
We compared them with the adjacent Loliondo Game Controlled
Area (GCA), an agricultural land essentially belonging to the
same savanna ecosystem but being almost exclusively used by
Maasai pastoralists.
Currently, there are still considerable limitations to estimate
GHGs from animals in free-range conditions, especially with
regard to their enteric CH4 output. In an attempt to capture the
variability associated with the calculation method, we applied
five different approaches to estimate GHGs from herbivore
animals (Supplementary Table 1), based mainly on the recent
IPCC guidelines12, refs. 13 and 14.
On average from the five different calculation approaches

In this study, we reveal a marked enhanced impact of the early-spring Aleutian Low (AL) on the following winter El Niño and
Southern Oscillation (ENSO) after the late-1990s. This enhanced impact of the early-spring AL may have an important contribution
to the increased emergence of the central Pacific ENSO during recent decades. After the late-1990s, decrease (increase) in the early-
spring AL strength tends to induce an anomalous cyclone (anticyclone) over subtropical North Pacific via wave-mean flow
interaction. The associated westerly (easterly) wind anomalies to the south side of the subtropical anomalous cyclone (anticyclone)
over the tropical western Pacific contribute to occurrence of central Pacific-like El Niño (La Niña) in the following winter via tropical
Bjerknes feedback. Further, the subtropical anomalous cyclone (anticyclone) leads to sea surface temperature (SST) increase
(decrease) in the equatorial Pacific in the following summer via wind-evaporation-SST (WES) feedback, which further contributes to
succeeding central Pacific-like El Niño (La Niña). Enhanced impact of early-spring AL on ENSO is attributable to enhancement of the
mean circulation over the North Pacific, which leads to increased wave-mean flow interaction and strengthened WES feedback after
the late-1990s. The results offer the potential to advance our understanding of the factors for the reduced prediction skill of ENSO
since the late-1990s.","INTRODUCTION
The El Niño and Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the dominant
mode of the tropical air-sea coupling system1–4, featured by large
sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the tropical central
and eastern Pacific, and accompanied by notable changes in the
tropical
atmospheric
circulation
and
convection.
ENSO
has
tremendous impacts on the climate, agriculture, ecosystems,
water resource and the livelihoods of people worldwide5–10.
Therefore, identifying the factors leading to the occurrence of
ENSO events and improving the prediction skill of ENSO are of
critical importance.
The prediction skill of ENSO is found to decrease obviously since
the late-1990s11,12, corresponding to the time when the central
Pacific (CP) type of El Niño has become more frequent13–15.
Extratropical atmospheric forcings over the North Pacific, particu-
larly the North Pacific Oscillation (NPO, the second Empirical
Orthogonal Function [EOF] mode of sea level pressure anomalies
[SLP] over the North Pacific)16, are suggested to contribute
significantly to the occurrence of the CP ENSO via the seasonal
footprinting mechanism and trade wind charging mechan-
ism17–25. However, two recent studies indicated that the impact
of the winter NPO on the following winter ENSO weakens largely
after the late-1990s26,27, suggesting that extratropical atmospheric
variability related to the winter NPO cannot totally explain the
recent increased emergence of the CP ENSO.
Then, what might be other sources of atmospheric variability
over the North Pacific that contributed to the recent frequent
occurrence of CP ENSO events? This study finds that the early-
spring (March) Aleutian Low (AL) may play an important role
though prevailing view generally suggested a marked impact of
the ENSO on the AL rather than the opposite effect6,28,29. The AL
intensity variation represents the first leading mode of atmo-
spheric variability over the North Pacific and explains more
variance than the NPO18 (Supplementary Fig. 1). A recent study
has preliminarily recognized that variation in the early-spring AL
intensity has a marked impact on the following winter ENSO
according to multiple reanalysis and observational data over 1979-
201630. However, whether the recent increased occurrence of CP
ENSO after the late-1990s is related to the impact of the early-
spring AL remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that the
impact of the early-spring AL on the following winter ENSO shows
a marked enhancement after the late-1990s. We suggest that this
enhanced impact of the early-spring AL may play an important
role in the increased occurrence of the CP type ENSO events
during recent decades. The physical mechanism for the enhanced
impact of the early-spring AL is also examined. Results of this
study may further improve our understanding of the change in
the ENSO type and improve the understanding of the process for
the impact of mid-high latitude atmospheric variability on
ENSO type.

The latitudinal precipitation distribution shows a secondary peak in midlatitudes and a minimum in the subtropics. This minimum is
widely attributed to the descending branch of the Eulerian Hadley cell. This study however shows that the precipitation distribution
aligns more closely with the transformed Eulerian mean (TEM) vertical motion. In Northern Hemisphere winter, maximum TEM
descent (ascent) and precipitation minimum (maximum) are collocated at ~20°N (~40°N). The subtropical descent is mostly driven
by the meridional flux of zonal momentum by large-scale eddies, while the midlatitude ascent is driven by the meridional flux of
heat by the eddies. When the poleward eddy momentum flux is sufficiently strong, however, the secondary precipitation peak
shifts to 60°N corresponding to the location of the TEM ascent driven by the eddy momentum flux. Moisture supply for the
precipitation is aided by evaporation which is enhanced where the TEM descending branch brings down dry air from the upper
troposphere/lower stratosphere. This picture is reminiscent of dry air intrusions in synoptic meteorology, suggesting that the
descending branch may embody a zonal mean expression of dry air intrusions. Moist air rises following the TEM ascending branch,
suggesting that the ascending branch may be interpreted as a zonal mean expression of warm conveyor belts. This study thus
offers a large-scale dynamics perspective of the synoptic description of precipitation systems. The findings here also suggest that
future changes in the eddy momentum flux, which is poorly understood, could play a pivotal role in determining the future
precipitation distribution.","INTRODUCTION
Precipitation variability has received considerable attention because
precipitation or lack thereof has a large societal impact. An improved
understanding of precipitation variability requires a firm grasp of
how the climatological mean state arises. It is well established that
most of the cold season extratropical precipitation is associated with
extratropical cyclones, and the precipitation maximum near 40°N in
midlatitudes (bottom panels in Fig. 1) is attributed to extratropical
storm activities1,2. Figure 1a shows that the precipitation minimum
in the subtropics is not caused by a lack of moisture because the
specific humidity is greater in the subtropics than in midlatitudes.
Instead, the precipitation minimum is commonly attributed to the
climatological high-pressure systems that form under the descend-
ing branch of the Hadley cells.
Comparing the precipitation distribution with the Eulerian
overturning circulation (Fig. 1b), however, we see that the
precipitation minimum peaks at ~20°N, while the descending
motion, measured by ω500, is strongest at ~30°N. Figure 1c shows
that the precipitation minimum instead aligns more closely with
the downward mass transport of the residual mean circulation of
transformed Eulerian mean (TEM) theory3,4. The TEM is different
from the Eulerian overturning circulation in that the former
includes a mass transport by the eddies as well as by the zonal
mean Eulerian overturning circulation. Moreover, the precipitation
maximum at ~40°N roughly coincides with the ascending branch
of the residual mean circulation in midlatitudes. These descending
and ascending branches form the U-shaped dip (for conciseness
“dip” hereafter) in the TEM overturning circulation (Fig. 1c). (Note
that unrealistically large TEM streamfunction values below 850
hPa are due to a weak static stability near the surface5, which may
be remedied by replacing the singular static stability in pressure
coordinate by isentropic static stability near the surface6.) Here, we
formally define the dip as the region bounded by the maximum
downwelling and upwelling
ω

, as indicated by the red
vertical lines in Fig. 1c. From this definition, we see that the dip
ranges between ~25°N and ~40°N. The dip remains robust when
the level of the vertical velocity is varied from 500 hPa to 700 hPa.
Using a two-layer model, Robinson7 first pointed out that eddy
momentum flux (EMF) convergence drives a TEM dip. This is
consistent with the “downward control” mechanism in which the
distribution of the full EP flux divergence aloft determines the
vertical motion at lower levels8. The portion of the TEM circulation
driven by the EMF contribution (Fig. 2a) exhibits sinking motion
centered at ~30°N (Fig. 2d) (calculation described in Materials and
Methods), a latitude where the TEM circulation shows sinking
motion but is located ~5° north of where the sinking motion is
strongest. However, the EMF-driven rising motion is centered at
~60°N (Fig. 2d), and it is eddy heat flux (EHF) divergence (Fig. 2b)
that drives the ascending branch of the dip at ~40°N (Fig. 2e). The
sum of the full eddy flux forcing (Fig. 2c) captures the overall
structure of the TEM circulation (compare Fig. 1c and Fig. 2f),
although some discrepancies can be observed in the tropics and
subtropics where impact of tropical convection cannot be
ignored9. This analysis indicates that the rather narrow climato-
logical dip, ranging between 25°N and 40°N, arises from the
combined effect of the two eddy fluxes. The sinking branch driven
by the EMF (30°N) is compensated by the EHF-driven rising
motion,

branch of the dip, it follows that the relative strength of the two

Heatwaves impose serious impacts on ecosystems, human health, agriculture, and energy consumption. Previous studies have
classified heatwaves into independent daytime, independent nighttime, and compound daytime-nighttime types, and examined
the long-term changes in the three types. However, the underlying mechanisms associated with the variations in different
heatwave types remain poorly understood. Here we present the first investigation of the local physical processes associated with
the daytime, nighttime, and compound heatwaves over the global land during 1979–2020. The results show that three heatwave
types occur frequently and increasingly in most regions worldwide. Nighttime and compound heatwaves exhibit stronger increases
in both frequency (the yearly number of the events) and fraction (the ratio of the yearly number of one heatwave type to the total
yearly number of all types) than daytime heatwaves. Composite diagnostic analyses of local meteorological variables suggest that
daytime heatwaves are associated with increased solar radiation under dry conditions and reduced cloud cover and humidity under
a clear sky. In contrast, nighttime heatwaves are typically accompanied by moist conditions with increases in cloud fraction,
humidity, and longwave radiation at night. These synoptic conditions for daytime and nighttime heatwaves are combined to
contribute to compound heatwaves. Local divergences and moisture fluxes responsible for different heatwaves are further
revealed. Positive moisture divergence anomalies are seen in most land areas for daytime and compound heatwaves, while they
mainly appear in low latitudes for nighttime heatwaves. Our research provides a comprehensive understanding of the local
mechanisms of different heatwave types, informing future risks and impact assessments.","INTRODUCTION
Heatwave hazards are prolonged extremely hot weather events
that can severely damage the environment, human health, and
socioeconomic development1–4. For example, the severe Eur-
opean heatwave in 2003 caused over 70,000 deaths and
enormous losses in agricultural production5. The 2010 Russian
heatwave accompanied by drought conditions and forest fires
resulted in 54,000 deaths6,7. It was observed that heatwaves have
intensified over the past decades, in terms of their magnitude,
frequency, and duration8,9. Under global warming, heatwave
events are projected to be further exacerbated and may produce
more harmful consequences on human society10,11. Heatwave
events have attracted much attention from the public and
scientists, and have become an essential research topic in recent
years12–14. For example, Perkins-Kirkpatrick and Gibson15 con-
cluded that heatwave duration is projected to increase by 2–10
days per degree celsius, with larger changes over lower latitudes.
Recent studies by You et al.16,17 based on multiple definitions
reported substantial increases in heatwave activities and extreme
temperatures in China over the past decades. Luo et al.18 found
that heatwaves in arid Northwest China exhibit significant
intensifying trends in terms of increasing frequency, prolonging
duration, and strengthening intensity.
The characteristics of heatwaves explored by previous studies
are mainly based solely on daytime maximum temperature
(Tmax)18–20. While nighttime heatwaves characterized by a high
daily minimum temperature (Tmin) have a significant effect on
human comfort and inhibit the relief from nighttime cooling, thus
possibly increasing threats to human health21–23. More hazardous
conditions will emerge when extreme daytime temperatures are
combined with the following warm nighttime for consecutive
days (i.e., compound heatwaves)22–24. For instance, the compound
heatwaves occurring in the mid-west of the United States in 1995

Chicago25.
Moreover,
synoptic
conditions associated with daytime, nighttime, and compound
heatwaves may differ26. It is necessary to distinguish different
heatwave types and reveal the involved physical mechanisms.
Atmospheric conditions leading to daytime heatwaves have
been well understood in the literature. One major factor causing
daytime heatwaves is the anomalous anticyclonic circulation in
the middle and upper troposphere, which generates subsidence
and warm advection8,27–29. The subsidence associated with
warming high-pressure anomalies prohibits cloud formation
resulting in clear skies, thus enhancing the surface shortwave
radiative heating and prolonging hot conditions30. For example,
Luo and Lau31 pointed out that heatwaves in southern China are
accompanied by anomalous anticyclones and high pressure near
the surface, resulting from the westward extension of the western
North Pacific subtropical high (WNPSH). On the other hand,
anomalous anticyclones can suppress convective activities, such
that forms a drier and hotter soil environment in favor of the
occurrence of heatwaves, as reported by Deng et al.32. In addition
to the subsidence, extreme heat events can also be controlled by
the intensity of temperature advection33,34. Previous studies also

As the world warms, extremely hot days are becoming more frequent and intense, reaching unprecedented temperatures
associated with excess mortality. Here, we assess how anthropogenic forcings affect the likelihood of maximum daily temperatures
above 50 °C at 12 selected locations around the Mediterranean and the Middle East. We adopt a risk-based attribution
methodology that utilises climate model simulations with and without human influence to estimate the probability of extremes. We
find that at all locations, temperatures above 50 °C would have been extremely rare or impossible in the pre-industrial world, but
under human-induced climate change their likelihood is rapidly increasing. At the hottest locations we estimate the likelihood has
increased by a factor of 10–103, whereas by the end of the century such extremes could occur every year. All selected locations may
see 1–2 additional months with excess thermal deaths by 2100, which stresses the need for effective adaptation planning.","INTRODUCTION
The world has warmed by about a degree since the beginning of
the 20th century and attribution research points to anthropogenic
drivers as the dominant cause1 with greenhouse gas emissions as
the major contributor to the warming2. The role of human
influence is also evident in regional warming since the 1950s3,
which, in turn, engenders an intensification of extreme heat
episodes4,5 that put a strain on human and, more widely,
ecosystem health6,7. Concern about the changing characteristics
of weather and climate extremes propelled the science of event
attribution8,9. A profusion of event studies have provided strong
evidence that hot extremes around the world are becoming more
frequent and intense as a result of anthropogenic climate
change10. The pioneering work of Stott et al. (2004) that set the
foundations of this new research area11, was motivated by the
deadly European summer heatwave of 2003 that claimed the lives
of 35,000–70,000 people12. Since then, further studies have shown
how anthropogenic forcings influence not only heatwaves, but a
range of different types of extremes, as well as climate change
impacts13. Continuing warming is expected to further exacerbate
risks, exposing billions of people to climatic conditions never
experienced over the last 6000 years14. Our study aims to offer
new insights into the looming reality of temperatures that would
not only break new records, but also, in the absence of effective
adaptation, could usher in calamitous socio-economic conse-
quences. Dangerous temperature thresholds in terms of local
impacts are sometimes easy to identify. For example, after
reaching a record temperature of 38.7 °C in Cambridge in July
2019, the possibility of exceeding 40 °C in the UK, which would
have been unthinkable a generation ago, began to appear within
reach. An attribution study indeed confirmed that the chances of
such an event are increasing so fast because of human influence,
that it could become common by the end of the century15. Only
two years after the study was published, a new UK record was set
at 40.3 °C16. Recent studies have also affirmed that Europe needs
to brace itself for summers hotter than 200317,18. Extreme heat
poses greater challenges to communities that are more vulnerable
because of their lower adaptive capacity. In Latin American cities,
for example, it is estimated that nearly a million of deaths during
2002–2015 are linked to temperature extremes19. Even in hot
countries like India, when one might expect the population is well-
adapted to high temperatures, extreme heat still takes its toll. For
example, during a persistent hot spell in Gujarat in May 2010,
excess mortality was found to have increased by 43%20.
The raft of adverse impacts associated with extreme heat makes
it imperative to understand how human climatic influences
change their characteristics. The strong links between extremely
high temperatures, a major contributor to heat stress, and excess
mortality have been well-documented21,22. Such impacts are
exacerbated in cities because of the urban heat island effect6. The
increasing frequency of extremes would also lead to a shift in
diseases23. Moreover, high temperatures have been shown to be
detrimental to mental health24 and associated with an increase in
the risk of suicide25. Excessive heat stress in hot ambient
conditions has also been shown to reduce productivity and put
a strain on occupational health26. Nevertheless, a billion outdoor
workers are estimated to be exposed to extreme heat, with a third
of them suffering ill health as a result6. As the climate continues to
change, hotter regions are projected to bear most of the burden
of heat-related health impacts in coming decades27. While the UK
public is concerned about crossings of the 40 °C threshold28,
hotter countries face the challenge of overshooting the more
perilous threshold of 50 °C more frequently, or even for the first
time in coming years. Here we use exceedances of t

Africa is highly vulnerable to climate change but emits a small portion of global greenhouse gases. Additionally, decarbonization
might lead to a ‘climate penalty’ whereby reductions in cooling aerosols offset temperature benefits from CO2 reductions for
several decades. However, climate change impacts conditions other than temperatures, including precipitation. Using the NASA
Goddard Institute for Space Studies climate model, we find that although African emissions cuts have weak impacts on projected
African temperatures, they significantly impact rainfall. Whereas business-as-usual increasing emissions lead to substantial drying
over tropical Northern Hemisphere Africa during local summer, that drying is essentially eliminated under a sustainable
development pathway. The reduction in cooling aerosols is responsible for ~33–90% of the avoided drying in our model, with the
remainder largely attributable to reduced absorbing aerosols. African policy choices may therefore greatly reduce regional African
summer drying, giving parts of Africa substantial leverage over their own climate and air quality future.","INTRODUCTION
Africa is developing rapidly, with rapid population growth,
economic growth, and urbanization1. The African Union’s Agenda
2063, the ‘Africa We Want’, articulates a vision for development
where people have improved and sustainable livelihoods, live in
clean environments with low air pollution, and where Africa
ensures that it is climate resilient. Though African countries aim to
play their role in limiting global climate change, as evidenced by
their latest NDC submissions, the perception is that local efforts to
address climate change are almost entirely about adaptation. This
is because local mitigation is expected to have little impact on
African climate change given that Africa emits less than 4% of
global (2020) CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and industry2.
Cooling aerosols, including sulfates, ammonium, nitrates, and
organic carbon, contribute to local air pollution and currently
mask a portion of the warming from increased greenhouse gases
(GHGs). Removal of these aerosols, either due to policies to
improve air quality or to mitigate climate change, can thus have
both beneficial and detrimental effects on society via changes in
both air quality and climate. There is a large body of literature on
the so-called ‘climate penalty’ attributable to reductions in cooling
aerosols that unmask greenhouse gas warming3–5. For example,
aerosol reductions that were implemented for the sake of air
quality have contributed to observed local warming in the US6,
Europe7 and China8. Although an instantaneous, global removal of
all cooling aerosols would lead to a sharp rise in global warming3,
a realistic phaseout of fossil fuel usage would only lead to a
modest ( ~ 0.02-0.10 °C) warming9. The knowledge that climate
mitigation can lead to near-term warming has led some to a focus
on strategies that prioritize the rapid reduction in emissions of
short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs), the strategy promoted by
the Climate and Clean Air Coalition. Adoption of both sustainable
development and SLCP reduction strategies provides a pathway
for near-term mitigation of both warming and drying10,11.
The climate scientific community continues to highlight the
temperature penalty associated with the aerosol decreases that
accompany GHG reductions. For instance, the latest Intergovern-
mental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report’s Summary for
Policy Makers highlights this ‘climate penalty’, stating that “In the
low and very low GHG emissions scenarios, assumed reductions in
anthropogenic aerosol emissions lead to a net warming”12.
Similarly, that report’s Frequently Asked Question 6.2 shows how
emission reductions lead to one or more of four outcome
categories: climate benefit, crop benefit, health benefit, and
climate penalty, with reductions in cooling aerosols leading to
health benefit and climate penalty impacts only. As Africa has a
particularly large ratio of aerosol to CO2 emissions, the climate
penalty in response to African decarbonization might be expected
to be especially large.
However, changing temperatures are only one aspect of climate
change, and aerosols are known to also play an important role in
regional precipitation changes13–16. Although many studies have
examined the influence of changing aerosols over Europe, North
America, and Asia, few have explored the role of African
aerosols17. The local impacts of reduced African aerosol emissions
may be especially important because the role of African green-
house gas emissions relative to other regions is minor. Therefore,
Africa’s large aerosol emissions may have relatively greater
influence on local future climate change than aerosol emissions
reductions in other parts of the world. Additionally, the cooling
aerosol changes could be particularly large as they include not
only sulfate aerosols associated with coal-fired power plants and
vehicles as in many other parts of the world, but also large
quantities of organic carbon aerosols primarily from solid biofuel
use18.

In July-August 2022, Yangtze River Valley (YRV) experienced unprecedented hot summer, with the number of heatwave days
exceeding climatology by four standard deviations. The heatwaves and associated severe droughts affected about 38 million
people and caused devastating economic losses of about five billion US dollars. Here we present convergent empirical and
modelling evidence to show that the record-breaking Pakistan rainfall, along with the 2022 tripe-dip La Niña, produces anomalous
high pressure over YRV, causing intense heatwaves. The La Niña-induced second-highest sea surface temperature gradient in the
equatorial western Pacific suppresses western Pacific convection and extends the subtropical high westward. More importantly, the
tremendous diabatic heating associated with the unprecedented Pakistan rainfall reinforces the downstream Rossby wave train,
extending the upper-level South Asia High eastward and controlling the entire YRV. The overlay of the two high-pressure systems
sustains sinking motion and increases solar radiation reaching the ground, causing recurrent heat waves.","INTRODUCTION
In recent years, heatwaves have become more frequent and
intense over East Asia1, such as the heatwaves over the Yangtze
River valley (YRV) in 20132, North China in 20183, and South China
in 20204. Heatwaves usually concur with high-pressure circulation
systems. The induced descending motion leads to decreased
cloud cover aloft and increased downward solar radiation at the
surface, which favors heatwave occurrence5,6. As the major high-
pressure system frequently controlling the YRV in midsummer, the
western Pacific subtropical High (WPSH) is critical for heatwave
formation, especially over its middle and lower reaches2,7,8.
Moreover, the upper-troposphere South Asia high (SAH) can also
strengthen and maintain heatwaves over the YRV by promoting
descending motion9,10. The westward expansion of the WPSH
often accompanies eastward expansion of the SAH. This coupling
appears to be caused by the SAH-enhanced middle-lower
tropospheric divergence and zonal temperature gradient over
subtropical East Asia11,12.
Previous studies have indicated the roles of tropical sea surface
temperature (SST) forcing in modulating the WPSH. The tropical
North Atlantic warming may induce a zonally overturning
circulation anomaly with anomalous descent over the tropical
central Pacific, which acts to enhance the WPSH via triggering a
Rossby wave response13–15. The Indian Ocean warming emanates
the eastward Kelvin waves to the western North Pacific (WNP),
which can suppress the convection and enhance the WPSH via the
coupled Indo-western Pacific Ocean capacitor16. More importantly,
the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) plays a crucial role in the
interannual variations of WPSH through air-sea interactions17–20. In
particular, Wang et al. (ref. 21) emphasized two leading modes of
low-level WPSH. The first mode is maintained by positive
atmosphere-ocean feedbacks with the Indian Ocean warming
and WNP cooling to prolong the effect of the wintertime El
Niño16,17,22, named as an atmosphere-ocean interaction mode23.
The second mode reflects an enhanced WPSH forced by the
summertime La Niña, regarded as a La Niña-forced mode19,24,25.
Besides the tropical SST forcing, the extratropical atmospheric
teleconnections in the mid-upper troposphere originating from
North Atlantic and Eurasia can propagate to East Asia and impact
the summer climate15,26–29. For example, the positive Scandina-
vian pattern propagates from the Scandinavian Peninsula across
Russia to East Asia30, which leads to high-pressure anomalies and
more heatwaves in North China31. As for YRV heatwaves, the roles
of the Silk Road pattern32 and the circumglobal teleconnection
(CGT) pattern33 have been highlighted6,15,31, where the Silk Road
pattern is considered to be part of CGT. The CGT is characterized
by a wavenumber-5 structure over West Asia, East Asia, North
Pacific, North America, and West Europe33. The CGT’s action center
over East Asia can displace the East Asia westerly jet northward,
promoting a northeastward extension of the SAH and a westward
expansion of the WPSH8,12,34. It is widely accepted that the Indian
summer monsoon (ISM) rainfall is a key factor in exciting the
CGT33,35,36. The diabatic heating source released by the anomalous
rainfall can excite an upper-level Rossby wave high over central
Asia37,38, enhancing the CGT pattern downstream along the
westerly jet-induced waveguide.
In 2022, high-intensity and long-lasting heatwaves hit the YRV

Given the leveling off in oxidized nitrogen emissions around the world, the atmospheric deposition of reduced nitrogen
(NHx = NH3 + NH4+) has become progressively critical, especially dry deposition, which presents great threats to plant growth. A
combination of historical deposition data of measured wet NHx and modeled dry NHx in China suggests that dry NHx deposition has
been increasing substantially (4.50% yr−1, p < 0.05) since 1980. Here, chemical transport model (WRF-EMEP) results indicate that
variation in NH3 emissions is not a dominant factor resulting in the continually increasing trends of dry NHx deposition, while
climate change-induced trends in precipitation patterns with less frequent light rain and more frequent consecutive rain events
(with ≥2 consecutive rainy days) contribute to the increase in dry NHx deposition. This will continue to shift NHx deposition from
wet to dry form at a rate of 0.12 and 0.23% yr−1 (p < 0.05) for the period of 2030–2100 in China under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5
scenarios, respectively. Further analysis for North America and Europe demonstrates results similar to China, with a consistent
increase in the contribution of dry NHx deposition driven by changing precipitation patterns from ~30% to ~35%. Our findings,
therefore, uncover the change of precipitation patterns has an increasing influence on the shifting of NHx deposition from wet to
dry form in the Northern Hemisphere and highlight the need to shift from total NHx deposition-based control strategies to more
stringent NH3 emission controls targeting dry NHx deposition in order to mitigate the potential negative ecological impacts.","INTRODUCTION
Nitrogen deposition, an important component of the global
nitrogen cycle, has increased twofold over the past 100 years
globally1 and by 60% from 1980 to 2010 in China2, as a result of
reactive nitrogen emissions associated with rapid expansion in
agriculture and increased fossil fuel combustion3. These reactive
nitrogen
species
include
reduced
(NHx = NH3 + NH4+)
and
oxidized (NOy = NOx (NO + NO2) + its oxidation products) com-
pounds. Given the continual reductions in NOx emissions, NHx
deposition has become increasingly important, with its contribu-
tion currently reaching 60–85% of the total nitrogen deposition in
the United States and Europe4–6. Enhanced NHx deposition is
favorable for crop production and plant growth in nitrogen-
limited regions7, whereas excess NHx deposition causes greater

mainly
through
scavenging by rainfall, sleet, fog, snow, and hail2,11, while dry
deposition occurs by vertical turbulent transfer to the earth’s

is a continuous process that drives plant species composition
change and reduces species cover and diversity much faster, and
inflicts greater threats to plant growth compared to the same unit
of wet NHx deposition12,13. Previous studies have characterized the
spatiotemporal variation and ecological effects of NHx deposition;
however, the main focus of these studies has been on wet NHx
deposition because it is relatively easy to measure in existing
networks2,11, whereas long-term and large-scale dry NHx deposi-
tion has been less studied due to the technical difficulty in directly
measuring and monitoring dry deposition. It has been reported
that dry NHx deposition has been a critical component of total NHx
deposition in recent years14,15. Based on a combination of
historical measurement-based wet NHx deposition and model-
based dry NHx deposition data, Yu et al.16 suggested that there
has been a shift in the relative contributions of wet and dry
deposition to total NHx deposition in China from 1980 to 2015;
wet deposition previously dominated total NHx deposition, but
the modeled ratio of dry to wet NHx deposition (RNHxðdry=wetÞ)
gradually rose from 1980 to 2015, to the point where wet and dry
deposition now have an approximately equal contribution to total
NHx deposition (Fig. 1). Thus, there is an urgent need to better
understand why dry NHx deposition and RNHxðdry=wetÞ
have
increased in China during the past decades according to the
modeled
deposition,
especially
when
NH3
emissions
have
remained stable since 200516.
The major factors that control the variation of NHx deposition
include emissions, meteorology, and land cover9,17,18. Chemical
transport models (CTMs) have been widely used to investigate the

Atmospheric chemistry transport models have been extensively applied in aerosol forecasts over recent decades, whereas they are
facing challenges from uncertainties in emission rates, meteorological data, and over-simplified chemical parameterizations. Here,
we developed a spatial-temporal deep learning framework, named PPN (Pollution-Predicting Net for PM2.5), to accurately and
efficiently predict regional PM2.5 concentrations. It has an encoder-decoder architecture and combines the preceding PM2.5
observations and numerical weather prediction. Besides, the model proposes a weighted loss function to promote the forecasting
performance in extreme events. We applied the proposed model to forecast 3-day PM2.5 concentrations over the Beijing-Tianjin-
Hebei region in China on a three-hour-by-three-hour basis. Overall, the model showed good performance with R2 and RMSE values
of 0.7 and 17.7 μg m−3, respectively. It could capture the high PM2.5 concentration in the south and relatively low concentration in
the north and exhibit better performance within the next 24 h. The use of the weighted loss function decreased the level of “high
values underestimation, low values overestimation”, while incorporating the preceding PM2.5 observations into the encoder phase
improved the predictive accuracy within 24 h. We also compared the model result with that from a state-of-the-art numerical model
(WRF-Chem with pollutant data assimilation). The temporal R2 and RMSE from the WRF-Chem were 0.30−0.77 and 19−45 μg m−3
while those from the PPN model were 0.42−0.84 and 15−42 μg m−3. The proposed model shows powerful capacity in aerosol
forecasts and provides an efficient and accurate tool for early warning and management of regional pollution events.","INTRODUCTION
Fine particulate matter (PM2.5, with an aerodynamic diameter of
<2.5 µm) has been identified as a key component of atmospheric
pollution in China due to large amounts of precursor emissions
and unfavorable meteorological conditions1, especially during
cold seasons. Inhaling PM2.5 of high concentration poses a serious
threat to public health, leading to increased risks of cardiovascular
and respiratory diseases2. Therefore, accurate prediction of PM2.5
concentrations is indispensable both for public health warnings
and emission controls.
The main approaches of PM2.5 prediction can be divided in two
categories: i.e., numerical models and statistical models. Numerical
models, such as the WRF-Chem3, CMAQ4, and GEOS-Chem5,
describe
the
essential
atmospheric
physical
and
chemical
processes through mathematical formulas, which establish the
explicable relationship among atmospheric components, meteor-
ological parameters, and emissions in spatial and temporal
dimensions. These numerical models, termed Chemistry Transport
Models (CTMs), have been extensively used in PM2.5 prediction6,7,
source apportionment8–10 and mechanism analysis11–13 world-
wide. However, large uncertainties arise from emission rates14,
meteorological data15, as well as the over-simplified chemical
parameterizations16, may result in certain deviations from the
observed PM2.5 concentrations. To reduce model uncertainties,
data assimilation has been extensively utilized to provide more
precise
initial
chemical
conditions
by
incorporating
in-situ
pollutant observations and satellite retrievals into CTMs17–21. It
showed beneficial effects on PM2.5 forecasts for up to 24 h while
the benefit from data assimilation diminished rapidly with forecast
range17,21. In addition, low computational efficiency is another
disadvantage of the CTMs, which usually take several hours for
one simulation day with fine resolution22.
Statistical
methods
essentially
establish
the
relationship
between multiple predictors and historically observed PM2.5
concentrations through regression models or machine learning
(ML) algorithms, which do not involve the complex physical and
chemical processes and usually have less demand for computing
resources compared to the CTMs. Initially, linear regression models
were applied to PM2.5 forecast and showed reasonable accuracy23.
However, the linear assumption in these models sometimes might
not precisely capture the connection between predictors and air
pollutant concentrations. In recent years, ML algorithms have
gained popularity in air quality forecast due to their strong power
in effectively handling nonlinear relationship between predictors
and targets24. For example, Ma et al.25 utilized the XGBoost
algorithm to predict PM2.5 concentrations in Shanghai and
reported a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.77 and Root Mean
Square Error (RMSE) of about 12–18 μg m−3 for 24 h ahead
prediction. Bi et al.26 developed a PM2.5 forecast system by
combing the random forest algorithm with CTM model results in
central China, which had R2 of 0.76 and 0.64 for the next 2 days.
These ML methods show good capacities in capturing non-linear
relationships between features and aerosol concentrations at
single sites. However, air pollutant forecasting is usually a regional
issue related to both spatial relations and time sequences. The
traditional ML methods are still difficult to resolve the complex
spatiotemporal correlations27.

As one of the least understood aerosol processes, nucleation can be a dominant source of atmospheric aerosols. Sulfuric acid (SA)-
amine binary nucleation with dimethylamine (DMA) has been recognized as a governing mechanism in the polluted continental
boundary layer. Here we demonstrate the importance of trimethylamine (TMA) for nucleation in the complex atmosphere and
propose a molecular-level SA-DMA-TMA ternary nucleation mechanism as an improvement upon the conventional binary
mechanism. Using the proposed mechanism, we could connect the gaseous amines to the SA-amine cluster signals measured in
the atmosphere of urban Beijing. Results show that TMA can accelerate the SA-DMA-based new particle formation in Beijing by
50–100%. Considering the global abundance of TMA and DMA, our findings imply comparable importance of TMA and DMA to
nucleation in the polluted continental boundary layer, with probably higher contributions from TMA in polluted rural environments
and future urban environments with controlled DMA emissions.","INTRODUCTION
As a major source of the number concentrations of aerosols and
cloud condensation nuclei in the global atmosphere, new particle
formation (NPF) exerts important influences on the global
climate1,2. At regional and local scales, NPF provides a substantial
aerosol surface area for heterogeneous physicochemical pro-
cesses, plausibly contributing to haze formation and affecting
human health3,4. Sulfuric acid (SA) is known as the primary
gaseous precursor for NPF in diverse atmospheric environments5.
With stabilizing bases such as amines, SA nucleates and efficiently
forms new particles6–8, which is a governing mechanism for
nucleation in the continental boundary layer9–12. As suggested by
laboratory and theoretical studies, many candidate bases in the
complex atmosphere may participate in SA nucleation and the
initial growth of stable clusters7,13,14. However, a mechanistic
understanding of SA-base nucleation has mainly been established
based on binary acid-base systems involving a single base type.
Dimethylamine (DMA) has been found to be the governing base
in well-controlled laboratory systems involving SA, DMA, ammo-
nia, and water6,8, and it has been recognized as a key base for
atmospheric SA nucleation10,11,15. However, the SA-DMA nuclea-
tion mechanism cannot fully explain the observed NPF rate. For
instance, at low DMA concentrations in urban Beijing, predictions
using the SA-DMA binary mechanism tend to underestimate the
concentrations of clusters containing two SA molecules11, imply-
ing significant, yet underestimated, contributions from other
bases. Identifying these other candidate bases is important for a
comprehensive understanding of NPF in complex atmospheric
environments.
Seeking other candidate bases in atmospheric nucleation
requires advances in both measurements and theories. On one
hand, the participation of a candidate base in atmospheric
nucleation needs to be evidenced in atmospheric observations.
This requires unambiguous detection of base molecules both in
the gas phase and in growing clusters, which is challenging due to
the interferences of many other species. On the other hand, the
knowledge of SA nucleation in several isolated binary sys-
tems14,16,17 may not add up to the SA nucleation mechanism in
the real atmosphere, as the mixture of multiple candidate bases is
expected to stabilize SA clusters synergistically18. A mechanism
that includes clusters consisting of multiple bases is therefore
fundamental to understanding the roles of bases in atmospheric
nucleation.
Considering the concentration and base strength of candidate
bases, trimethylamine (TMA) is a promising species for atmo-
spheric nucleation. As a major component of atmospheric
amines19, TMA is often found in the emission sources of DMA.
Compared to DMA, TMA has smaller or comparable abundances in
mobile sources and residential solid fuel combustion sources, and
usually higher abundances in biological sources such as animal
husbandry20,21. Consequently, one can expect that in various
atmospheric
environments,
the
TMA
concentration
can
be
comparable to or even higher than the DMA concentration.
Laboratory experiments have shown that TMA is almost as
effective as DMA in forming clusters containing two SA molecules7
and new particles22. This finding is also supported by theoretical
studies on the formation of SA clusters containing up to two SA
molecules17,23. These results suggest that TMA likely contributes
to atmospheric NPF. However, the role of TMA in atmospheric
nucleation remains unclear and unverified, urging measurement

The reliability of the near-land-surface air temperature (LSAT) projections from the state-of-the-art climate-system models that
participated in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase six (CMIP6) is debatable, particularly on regional scales. Here we
introduce a method of constructing a constrained multi-model-ensemble (CMME), based on rejecting models that fail to reproduce
observed LSAT trends. We use the CMME to constrain future LSAT projections under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways 5–8.5
(SSP5–8.5) and 2–4.5 (SSP2–4.5), representing the high and intermediate scenarios. In comparison with the “raw” (unconstrained)
CMIP6 multi-model ensemble (MME) mean, the impact of the observation-based constraint is less than 0.05oC 100 years−1 at a
global scale over the second half of 21st century. However, the regional results show a wider range of positive and negative
adjustments, from -1.0oC 100 years−1 to 1oC 100 years−1 under the SSP5–8.5 scenario. Although amplitude under SSP2–4.5 is
relatively smaller, the CMME adjustment is similar to that under SSP5–8.5, indicating the scenario independency of the CMME
impact. The ideal 1pctCO2 experiment suggests that the response of LSAT to carbon dioxide (CO2) forcing on regional scales is
responsible for the MME biases in the historical period, implying the high reliability of CMME in the 21st century projections. The
advantage of CMME is that it goes beyond the idea of “model democracy” assumed in MME. The unconstrained CMIP6 MME may
be overestimating the risks of future warming over North America, but underestimating the risks over Asia.","INTRODUCTION
The CMIP6 program is the most recent effort in coordinating the
design and distribution of a large number of the state-of-the-art
climate model simulations of the past, present, and future
climates1. It serves as the basis for the sixth Assessment Report
of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR6)2. The
observed global warming trend can be generally well captured by
the state-of-the-art climate system models participating in CMIP63.
Almost two-thirds of the impacts related to atmospheric and ocean
temperature changes can be confidently attributed to anthropo-
genic forcing4. There is a linear relationship between global mean
surface air temperature and the equivalent-CO2 concentrations5.
The equivalent-CO2 is calculated by converting amounts of all the
greenhouse gases to the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide with
the same global warming potential. The contribution from
equivalent-CO2 to historical global mean surface air temperature
is about 70% on multi-decadal or longer timescales.
Greenhouse gases (GHG), CO2 in particular, are considered to be
the major external forcing in the 20th century and will also have a
crucial impact in the 21st century projection. A high correlation
between global mean near-surface air temperature and the CO2
concentrations has also been found in future projections6.
However, many of the latest CMIP6 models have larger climate
sensitivities than the previous CMIP5 generation7–9. Higher climate
sensitivity indicates the ‘hot model’ problem in CMIP6 models10,
and the larger climate sensitivity range suggests a wider range of
warming responses to CO2-forcing and larger model uncertainty in
future warming projections11.
There have been several studies trying to narrow uncertainty
on estimates of past and future human-induced warming
based on detection and attribution techniques or metrics of
climate sensitivity12,13. There is a strong correlation between
the
recent
global
warming
trend
and
transient
climate
response (TCR), and the past warming trend therefore can be
used to constrain future warming projections in climate models
on global scales14. But most of the previous studies focus on
the projections on a global scale15. However, it is regional-scale
changes that are of vital importance for the impacts of climate
change. Under global warming, climate changes are more
extreme regionally and induce more severe impacts. For
example, the rate of heatwaves increases since the mid-
twentieth century, but trend magnitudes are not globally
uniform. Decadal trends in the frequency of heatwaves are
biggest over northern South America, the Middle East, and the
Maritime Continent at 50% per decade, but range between
10% and 30% per decade over most of the other regions16. In
this study, we try to constrain future warming projections but
focus on regional land surface air temperature (LSAT) trend
projection under the high-emission SSP5–8.5 scenario and
intermediate-emission SSP2–4.5 scenario17. The SSP5–8.5 and
SSP2–4.5 update the RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 in CMIP5 and have the
most participating climate models. We only focus on surface air
temperature trend over land since Atlantic multidecadal
oscillation (AMO) and Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) account
for most of the decadal variability over the oceans5,18,19.

Compared with individual extreme events, compound events have more severe impacts on humans and the natural environment.
This study explores the change in severity of compound extreme high temperature and drought/rain events (CHTDE/CHTRE) and
associated influencing factors. The CHTDE and CHTRE intensified in most areas of China in summer (June–July August) during
1961–2014. Under global warming, the increased water-holding capacity of the atmosphere and the decreased relative humidity
led to an increase in the severity of CHTDE. The severity of CHTRE is increased because of enhanced transient water vapor
convergence and convective motion. Anthropogenic climate change, especially greenhouse gas forcing, which contributes 90% to
the linear change in the severity of CHTDE and CHTRE, is identified as the dominant factor affecting the severity of CHTDE in China.
In addition, the historical natural forcing (hist-NAT) may be related to the interannual-to-decadal variability in the severity of
CHTDE/CHTRE.","INTRODUCTION
Over recent years, extreme precipitation events, extreme drought
events, extreme high temperature events and extreme storm
events have occurred frequently and have had devastating
impacts on human life and the ecological environment in many
places1–4. For example, 38.305 million people were affected by the
extreme high temperature event in China during the summer of
20225. In the summer of 2021, China experienced many extreme
rainfall
events,
each
of
which

losses
of
approximately US$12 billion6. Furthermore, the Lancet Count-
down Regional Centre in Asia reported that hundreds to
thousands of people lose their lives in extreme floods each year
in China, and millions to tens of millions of people cannot drink
water because of extreme droughts7. In particular, in the context
of global warming, compound extreme weather and climate
events, which are multivariate extremes at multiple temporal and
spatial scales that can further exacerbate the risks and effects of
individual extreme events, have become more frequent. Com-
pound extreme events have great impacts on crops, grassland
ecosystems
and
vegetation3,8–10.
Thus,
climate change
has
become one of the most severe challenges facing humankind.
Attaching great importance to the change in different types of
compound extreme events and research it is the key to preventing
and mitigating natural disasters and ensuring economic develop-
ment and human happiness.
Since the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special
Report on Climate Extremes (IPCC SREX) first explicitly proposed
the conception of compound extreme events in 201211, the
definition of compound extreme events has been continuously
enriched and expanded3,12. For compound extreme high tem-
perature and drought/rain events (CHTDE and CHTRE), the
quantitative identification methods can be classified into three
categories12–14. One category is that the concurrent extremes of
different variables should be greater than or less than their
specified extreme thresholds15–17. Another category is to recog-
nize compound events based on empirical statistical models of
meteorological indicators such as compound drought and the
heat wave magnitude index8,18–20. The third category is to
implement the probability statistic indicator based on joint
distributions of multiple single-event indicators. In this category,
the effects of dependence and interaction between multiple
extreme driving factors and compound extreme events are
investigated14,21,22. The Standardized Compound Event Indicator
developed from the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and
Standardized Temperature Index are good examples of this
category23. However, most of these indicators are obtained based
on data at the monthly time scale, whereas the variation at the
daily time scale is smoothed out. In addition, the interaction
between
different
time
scales
and
physical
meteorological
elements is not well considered, and the extreme degree of
compound events is not well quantified at present13,24.
Increasing attention has been given to CHTDE in recent years.
The IPCC AR63 report indicates that the occurrence probability of
CHTDE has been increasing at the global scale since the 1950s,
and the frequency and intensity of CHTDE have increased with
high confidence. Wang et al.25 investigated the spatiotemporal
changes in CHTDE over global land using SPI and the copula
method. They demonstrated that the significant increase in the
probability of CHTDE depends on the increase in the negative
correlation between temperature and SPI. In China, monthly
CHTDE shows a significant increasing trend, especially in North-
east China, where the occurrence probability of CHTDE has
increased by 0.05 per decade26–28. In addition, the continuous and

Climate model simulations run under the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) use an inhomogeneous
biomass burning aerosol (BBA) emission dataset, which exhibits pronounced interannual variability from 1997–2014 due to
the infusion of satellite data. Using the Community Earth System Model version 2 Large Ensemble (CESM2-LE) with original
and smoothed CMIP6 BBA forcings, we show that the CMIP6 data inhomogeneity causes spurious decadal subarctic land
warming. During years with reduced aerosol concentrations, increased solar radiation can trigger abrupt subarctic permafrost
thawing, increased soil water drainage, upper soil drying, and subsequent surface warming. This slow process, which is further
amplified by nonlinear cloud-aerosol interactions, cannot be completely offset during years of increased aerosol fluxes,
thereby reddening surface temperature spectra in response to large-amplitude interannual aerosol forcing. More generally,
our CESM2 experiments identify a pathway for generating decadal variability in high latitudes, involving interannual
shortwave forcing and slow nonlinear soil responses.","INTRODUCTION
The Earth’s climate trajectory is determined by a combination of
internally-generated fluctuations and external forcings such as
greenhouse gases, aerosols, land-use changes, and other factors.
Uncertainties in aerosol forcings continue to pose challenges to
climate hindcasts and projections1,2. To reduce the prevailing
aerosol forcing uncertainties, newer generations of climate models
have
incorporated
an
increasing
number
of
observational
constraints on historical aerosol emissions3–5. As part of this
effort, global biomass burning aerosol (BBA) emissions used in the
Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6)3 were
updated with a merged dataset of satellite observations6, fire
proxies, and fire model output. In the merged BBA dataset, the
incorporation of the satellite-based data has introduced an abrupt
onset of large interannual variability over 1997–2014, with
substantially weaker interannual variability before3,7,8 (Supple-
mentary Fig. 1b). Although this approach utilizes best estimates of
fire emissions based on available observational products, it
implicitly assumes that climate impacts of aerosol forcing will be
equivalent as long as the net aerosol fluxes remain the same over
an extended period (multiple years), regardless of the magnitude
of interannual variability. The invocation of this assumption
reflects the fact that very little is known about the impacts of
interannual variations in BBA emissions on climate.
The discontinuity in interannual variability of BBA forcing in
CMIP6
between
the
satellite
observation-based
period
(1997–2014) and the periods before and after is especially
pronounced over boreal North America and Siberia, where
interannual variations of fire occurrences and related aerosol
emissions are strong (Fig. 1b). Boreal fires are largely affected by
mean climatic conditions that are further modulated by different
modes of climate variability such as the El Niño-Southern
Oscillation, the Arctic Oscillation, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation,
or the Pacific-North American Pattern9–13. Human intervention is
also important through changes in land use, ignition, fire control,
and other perturbations14–16. With amplified warming in the
northern high latitudes, boreal wildfires have been occurring more
frequently and intensely with regional dependencies17, and this
trend is expected to increase under sustained increases in
anthropogenic forcings18–23. Earth system models predict that
changes in mean climate alter natural variability across a broad
range of timescales24, which would, in turn, affect the variability of
fire occurrences. As such, it is timely to ask whether and how
changes in year-to-year fluctuations in boreal BBA emissions
influence regional and global climate.
Recent studies have documented a northern high latitude
warming response to interannually varying BBA emissions in
model simulations7,25 (Supplementary Fig. 1a). These studies have
suggested that nonlinearities in aerosol-cloud processes can
generate the mean warming response in high BBA variability
simulations relative to low BBA variability simulations. However,
nonlinearities in atmospheric processes, including aerosol impacts
and associated feedbacks, alone cannot account for the sustained
warming over decadal timescales (Supplementary Fig. 1c), as the
typical lifetime of aerosols from fire emissions is in the order of
just a few days.
With such a predominantly atmospheric
mechanism, atmospheric responses could only fluctuate on
interannual timescales and synchronously with the enhanced
BBA variability. One may then expect a role of the ocean
generating longer timescale responses25. Ocean heat storage
and release could be considered a viable candidate mechanism
for early winter warming over the Arctic Ocean under high BBA
variability as the Arctic Ocean warming response maximizes in
November (Supplementary Fig. 2) despite near zero BBA emissions

Diagnosing El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) predictability within operational forecast models is hindered by computational
expense and the need for initialization with three-dimensional fields generated by global data assimilation. We instead examine
multi-year ENSO predictability since the late 1800s using the model-analog technique, which has neither limitation. We first draw
global coupled model states from pre-industrial control simulations, from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6, that
are chosen to initially match observed monthly sea surface temperature and height anomalies in the Tropics. Their subsequent 36-
month model evolution are the hindcasts, whose 20th century ENSO skill is comparable to twice-yearly hindcasts generated by a
state-of-the-art European operational forecasting system. Despite the so-called spring predictability barrier, present throughout the
record, there is substantial second-year ENSO skill, especially after 1960. Overall, ENSO exhibited notably high values of both
amplitude and skill towards the end of the 19th century, and again in recent decades.","INTRODUCTION
Seasonal-to-interannual prediction skill and potential predictabil-
ity of El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) have varied over the
past several decades1–6. Higher forecast skill appears evident
during periods of larger amplitude ENSO events2,7, but whether
such changes in ENSO forecast skill represent inherent changes in
potential predictability remains an active research question8–10.
For example, multi-decadal changes in the climate base states
might modulate ENSO characteristics, making its evolution less
predictable in some decades than in others8–11. How internal and
externally forced processes could combine to drive such base
state changes is itself unclear7. Alternatively, event-to-event
variations in ENSO amplitude and pattern might occur by chance,
driven by unpredictable atmospheric weather, with related long-
term – but similarly unpredictable – variations in ENSO forecast
skill12–16. Some studies have found that ENSO predictions might
be skillful for forecast leads of at least two years, but again with
substantial event-to-event variation in skill7,17–21.
Characterizing decadal variations in ENSO skill requires suffi-
ciently long hindcast records, that is, retrospective forecasts
initialized using only those observations potentially available at
the forecast time. Unfortunately, most hindcast datasets gener-
ated by coupled climate models typically cover only 20–30
years22, due to computational cost and the need for three-
dimensional global analyses for their initialization. Some longer
hindcast records have more recently been developed1,20,22;
however, these datasets are limited, either by restricting the
frequency of initialization to only a few times a year, and/or by
capping the forecast lead times at one year.
Here, the model-analog approach23,24 is used to extend ENSO
hindcasts back to the late 1800s and to investigate the long-term
variation of ENSO forecast skill, including its dependence upon the
seasonal cycle. In traditional analog forecasting, observed states
are found that are (in some sense) close matches to the current
initial state, and their evolution in the past is used to make a
current forecast25. This approach may not be too skillful if the
available library of previous climate states is limited26. However,
climate simulations in excess of 500 years could provide sufficient
data for analog forecasting23. That is, their more extensive
databases can be used to generate ensembles of suitable initial
states. Then, how these states evolve within the model simulations
provides the forecast ensemble, with no additional model
integration needed, making the model-analog climate predictions
computationally efficient. Such model-analog ensembles have
been shown to yield ENSO prediction skill comparable to
traditional assimilation-initialized hindcasts made by the same
operational climate models23. The model-analog technique has
been successfully applied to, for example, seasonal forecasts23,24,
decadal predictions27, and climate projections28.
There are a few additional advantages of using model-analog
ensembles to make hindcasts for an extended historical period.
First, both the initial conditions (i.e., model-analog states) and the
subsequent model-analog ensemble lie entirely within the model
space, which may avoid initialization shock29 commonly seen in
initialized forecast systems, arising primarily from an imbalance
between the initial analyzed state and all model states. Moreover,
the selection of these model-analog states based upon only a few
monthly-averaged variables, such as sea surface temperature
anomalies (SSTA) and sea surface height anomalies (SSHA),
nevertheless appears sufficient to generate hindcasts that capture
monthly tropical Indo-Pacific skill found in operational model
hindcasts. This appears true even for the skill of some variables not
used to choose the initial model-analog ensemble, notably
including precipitation, since any variable output as part of the
mode

Extreme cold fronts are closely associated with the spread of large wildfires in Australia. The strength of a front is determined by the
drop in temperature across it, which will in turn be determined by the warm and cold temperature anomalies on either side of the
front. Here, we examine the Black Saturday and Ash Wednesday fires in southeast Australia through a Lagrangian decomposition
framework, exploring the origin of the potential temperature anomalies that formed these extreme cold fronts. We identify the
contributions of three processes: an initial anomaly at the origin, adiabatic transport of climatologically different air, and diabatic
heating along the air-parcel trajectory. We find that on both sides of the cold front descending trajectories contribute to the
extreme anomalies. In the warm sector, positive anomalies arrive with descending trajectories from the Indian Ocean. In the cold
sector, negative anomalies are dominated by strongly descending dry intrusions forming as part of the cyclonic system. The dry
intrusions advect colder air, overcompensating for its adiabatic warming during its descent. Identification of the precursors and the
mechanisms contributing to extreme cold fronts associated with large wildfires can improve the forecast of such events and help
evaluate them in future climate projections.","INTRODUCTION
As wildfires endanger vast areas of vegetation, wildlife and
human population, understanding the factors affecting the
spread of fire is of great importance. Studies indicate that
wildfires may increase in frequency and intensity in the near
future under a warming climate with clear trends observed in
several parts of the world, including western United States1 and
Australia2. In Southeast Australia an increase in fire weather
frequency has been associated with a poleward shift of the
storm track3,4 and an increase in frequency of cold fronts has
been associated with the Australian fire season of 2019-20205.
Historical
extreme
wildfires
can
provide
insight
into
the
conditions leading to the spread of such disastrous events.
Understanding the precursors and contributing mechanisms can
improve forecast and management of these events by incorpor-
ating and identifying them in weather prediction and fire
management models and may increase forecast accuracy and
enhance early warning systems. Furthermore, understanding the
underlying mechanisms will help evaluate wildfire behavior
under future climate scenarios.
Many components act together during wildfire outbreaks, and
involve both land and atmospheric systems and feedbacks that
produce the right environmental conditions. Considering atmo-
spheric systems that govern the environmental conditions, cold
fronts are the most prominent ones in southeast Australia. Cold
fronts are formed within a synoptic environment of a large
temperature gradient, and here it is our goal to understand its
drivers. Atmospheric mechanisms of varying scales have been
associated with the spread of these wildfires, from large scale
phenomena such as Rossby wave breaking in the upper levels
with a strong potential vorticity (PV) anomaly6 to smaller,
shorter-term weather phenomena such as a sharp temperature
gradient on the 850 hPa level7,8, or abrupt surface drying9. The
spread of the largest fires in Southeast Australia is most
commonly
associated
with
the
passage
of
extreme
cold
fronts6,7,10–12. Strong winds as well as changes in wind direction
that accompany the passage of the front lead to a rapid growth
of an extended fire progression line. The speed of the passing
front at the surface is connected to the speed of the synoptic
system in which it is embedded13. Such intense fronts are
characterized by high temperature anomalies and extreme heat
waves ahead of the front11,14,15 and cold temperature anomalies
behind it. In this study we focus on the large scale dynamical
processes leading to the conditions surrounding the formation
of the cold front.
A Lagrangian approach that tracks the evolution of temperature
along the motion of the selected air masses15–18 can be useful for
understanding temperature anomalies. Because potential tem-
perature is conserved in adiabatic processes, changes in the
potential temperature along the trajectory allow us to isolate three
factors that contribute to the anomaly θ0 at the target time t1 and
location x1. The anomaly is defined as the difference of potential
temperature (θ) from its local climatological mean (θclim), as
described in the equation:

1983. We implement a Lagrangian framework and analyze air
mass trajectories in each case, to examine the origin of the
extreme temperature drop across the cold front. A decomposition

The response of terrestrial water storages to dryland vegetation growth remains poorly understood. Using multiple proxies from
satellite observations and model outputs, we show an overall increase (decrease) in vegetation growth (terrestrial water storages)
across drylands globally during 1982–2016. Terrestrial water storages in greening drylands correlate negatively with vegetation
growth, particularly for cropland-dominated regions, and such response is pronounced when the growth rate of vegetation
productivity is high. Reduction in terrestrial water storage is dominated by precipitation and evapotranspiration variability rather by
than runoff. We predict reduction in terrestrial water storage of 41–84% by 2100, accompanying expansion of drylands by
4.1–10.6%. Our findings, which indicate sustained adverse response of terrestrial water storage to vegetation growth in drylands,
highlight the need for concerted planning for balanced ecological restoration, agricultural management, and water resource
utilization that will affect 5.17 billion people, 64% of whom live in developing countries.","INTRODUCTION
Drylands are generally characterized by water shortage, infertile
soil, and scant coverage of vegetation. Such regions include water-
scarce environments such as deserts, croplands, grasslands, and
shrublands that account for approximately 40% of the global land
area1. Drylands provide food, energy, water, and ecosystem
services; consequently, their long-term sustainable development is
a critical issue. Furthermore, intensive human interventions and
extreme climatic regimes accompanying global climate change
are expected to render dryland ecosystems even more sensitive to
the growing dangers of extreme events such as drought and
heatwave2,3.
Crop and livestock productions are the principal economic
activities in dryland regions, sustaining over 38% of the global
human population. Therefore, regional vegetation growth is
critically important4, and high-quality long-term spatiotemporally
consistent records of vegetation growth are of considerable
relevance for assessing such environmental ecosystems. While
ground measurements and modeling evidence indicate reduced
vegetation productivity in arid and semi-arid regions over recent
decades5,6, earth observation studies have revealed a more
nuanced situation with signs of both decrease and increase7,8. In
particular, despite massive swaths of deforestation globally, such
as in the dry woodlands of Africa and Asia9, satellite observations
have revealed earth’s greening in recent decades as a conse-
quence of substantial human interventions10. For example, China,
India, Australia, and regions of the Sahel in North Africa have
exhibited
a
broad
trend
of
greening11,12.
Collectively,
the
vegetation dynamics of drylands reported in the literature appear
inconsistent, reflecting the facts that areas of greening and
browning are highly geographically and temporally heteroge-
neous, and that worldwide vegetation dynamics are complicated
by the nexus among environmental conditions, climatic elements,
and
human
activities.
Consequently,
little
consensus
exists
currently regarding the complete picture of how and to what
extent dryland vegetation trends are altered globally in the
context of continuous human interventions and climate change.
Sustainable growth of vegetation generally requires a contin-
uous supply of water; therefore, the pressure on water resources
demanded by anthropogenic and ecological activities continues
to grow. Vegetation restoration projects on the Loess Plateau, in
China, and in northern India have nearly reached the limit of the
soil water carrying capacity for vegetation13,14. The underlying
mechanisms of the hydrological cycle in drylands are complex,
involving multipath interactions, feedbacks, and sensitivities
between vegetation, atmosphere, and hydrology15–17. The ques-
tion of whether vegetation variation affects soil drying or wetness
is a subject of active debate in relation to global drylands. Several
studies found that vegetation greening increases evapotranspira-
tion (ET), resulting in excessive soil water demand and more
ecological drought18,19, while others reported that vegetation has
ecological
functions
of
water
conservation
and
water
use
efficiency regulation, and that precipitation can compensate for
soil moisture (SM) loss due to increased ET20–22. This controversy
relates to the variety of assessments based on different available
datasets from different regions and on different spatio-temporal
scales. Furthermore, a knowledge gap remains regarding the
response and shift of terrestrial water storage (TWS) in relation to
future vegetation dynamics, particularly under the background of
global climate change23–25, which restricts our ability to manage
agricultural forestry and animal husbandry.
Herein, we examine the trends of vegetation growth and
terrestrial water storages of earth’s drylands over the past four
decades, and assess the response of terrestrial water storages to
vegetation growth. Drylands were confined to the regions wit

Future climate changes are projected to adversely affect mortality risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in urbanized regions.
However, future temperature-related excess CVD hospitalizations in rural residents with poorer socioeconomic status is not well
understood. Moreover, influence of aging and declining rural population are rarely considered. Using CVD hospitalizations in rural
residents during 2010–2016 in eight regions in southeastern China, the region-specific temperature-CVD associations were
estimated by generalized additive models, which were combined by a meta-regression. We projected excess CVD hospitalizations
due to temperature using regional associations for 27 climate models under scenarios of climate change for 2010–2099. To reveal
the influences of aging and declining rural population, age-specific associations and future population change ratio were used to
estimate age-specific number of temperature-related hospitalizations. We found that heat-related hospitalizations in rural residents
from ischemic stroke, ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease are projected to increase in the 2090 s, although the
excess CVD hospitalizations associated with future temperature in rural residents will reduce in the 2090 s. Rural population aging
amplifies temperature-related CVD burden by >2.34-fold under SSPs in the 2050 s compared to scenarios with only population
declining, although rural population reduction will reduce the temperature-related CVD hospitalizations in the 2090 s. The elderly,
male and those lived in Longyan and Sanming could be more affected. These findings suggest that future heat is projected to
increase hospitalizations of some CVD subcategories. Policies are needed to mitigate increasing temperature and baseline
hospitalization rate. The impact of population aging is noteworthy.","INTRODUCTION
Globally, there were 17.9 million deaths due to CVD in 2016,
accounting for 32% of all deaths1. In 2030, The CVD is projected to
be the cause of >23.0 million deaths2. Meanwhile, CVDs accounted
for 24% of all hospital admission among middle-aged people from
21 countries, and accounted for 59% in the developing countries3.
In China, the prevalence of CVD is serious and continues to rise,
and the death rate is higher in rural regions than that in urban
regions4.
Ongoing climate change has received increasing attention,
characterized by increasing surface temperature5. Previous studies
collected and analyzed historical data, and suggested that warmer
temperatures may increase the hospital admission from CVD and
its subcategories6. Moreover, the global surface temperature is
predicted to increase between 2.6 oC and 4.8 oC from 1986–2005
to 2081–2100 under high-emission scenarios, which may con-
tribute to an increased incidence of CVD in future. Thus, projecting
potential influence of continued warming in the future is critical
for policymakers to develop mitigation initiatives to minimize
future CVD burden.
Current studies have focused on projections of CVD deaths
related to future non-optimal temperature in highly developed
urban areas7,8, resulting in considerable uncertainties when
generalizing the evidence to morbidity (i.e. hospital admission)
or to regions with diverse socioeconomic levels. In the context of
global warming and frequent heat events, heat-related excess
mortality is projected to increase in China, especially among the
population
in
the
southeastern
region,
with
cardiovascular
disease, or with lower levels of education7,9. However, there is a
lack of evidence regarding the projections of excess CVD hospital
admission
attributable
to
future
temperature
among
rural
residents, those with poorer socioeconomic level and lower level
of education. Moreover, previous studies were limited to project
potential influence of increasing temperature on total CVD7,8,10,
and very limited evidence on its common subcategories, such as
ischemic heart disease and stroke11. Further studies are needed to
project temperature-related hospital admissions from different
cause-specific CVDs. Third, the current studies have mainly
reported the excess CVD related to future temperature in a
short-time period within the 2010 s–2070 s10–12, but few studies
clearly revealed the trend in a long-time period. It is known that
older adults with poor physiological and social condition are

Over the past century, Northern Hemisphere (NH) land monsoon rainfall (NHLMR) experienced significant decadal to multidecadal
variations, mainly driven by an east–west sea surface temperature (SST) contrast over the Pacific (EWPC) and an interhemispheric
North Atlantic–South Indian Ocean SST dipole (NAID). However, how the NHLMR’s decadal variation would vary and whether the
oceanic forcing could continue to drive it in a warming world remain unexplored. Here, by analyzing 24 Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models’ historical simulations and future projections, we show that the leading mode of
decadal NHLMR will retain its nearly-uniform spatial pattern and representation of the NHLMR’s intensity. In the future, the
significant periodicities of decadal NHLMR are shortened as emissions levels increase. The intensity of decadal NHLMR variation will
experience a comprehensive decline under various emission scenarios, which may link to the weakened intensity of NAID and
EWPC. Although the relationship between EWPC and decadal NHLMR is slightly weakened in the future, EWPC will remain a primary
driver while NAID is no longer. The significant historical correlation between NAID and NHLMR is mainly attributed to the influence
of increased anthropogenic aerosols emission. However, the NAID-NHLMR linkage would no longer exist owing to the decline of
anthropogenic aerosol emission in the future.","INTRODUCTION
Monsoon is a forced response of the coupled atmosphere-land-
ocean system to annual variation of solar radiation1. Sufficient
monsoon precipitation sustains nearly two-thirds of the world’s
population and is the source of industrial, agricultural, and
domestic
water.
Thus,
it
is
vital
to
economic
and
social
development2–4. Projecting future changes in global monsoon
rainfall is of fundamental societal and scientific importance.
Primary sources of the uncertainties in projecting near-term
future changes of global monsoon come from the internal
variability and the uncertainties in the model’s representation of
the real world5. The projected near future change of monsoons is
critically affected by decadal variability. Therefore, understanding
the monsoon’s decadal variability and its associated physical
process in a warmer climate is crucial to future climate prediction
and adaptation.
Previous studies have shown that East Asian and Indian
monsoon precipitation experienced decadal variability in the
historical period6–9. Efforts have been made to explore the causes
of decadal variability in individual regional monsoons. Decadal
variation of East Asian land monsoon rainfall was primarily linked
to cooling over the central-eastern tropical Pacific and warming
over the extratropical North Pacific and western tropical Pacific10.
The interdecadal shift of the Indian summer monsoon (ISM)
around the late twentieth century was attributed to Interdecadal
Pacific Oscillation (IPO)11. Furthermore, Atlantic Multidecadal
Oscillation (AMO) and IPO also significantly contribute to the
decadal variations in West Africa monsoon12. However, on the
decadal or longer time scale, monsoon rainfall is mainly regulated
by planetary-scale
factors13. Investigating
monsoon decadal
variability from a global perspective might be more appropriate.
Thus, by analyzing long-term observation data, the decadal
variability
of
Northern
Hemisphere
land
monsoon
rainfall
(NHLMR), which profoundly impacts the global hydroclimate, is
found to be primarily driven by an east-west thermal contrast in
the Pacific (EWPC) and a north-south hemispheric thermal contrast
in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans (NAID)14. Both the EWPC and
NAID drivers are regional manifestations of IPO/AMO related SST
anomalies, which are demonstrated to modulate monsoon
precipitation substantially15,16.
How would NHLMR vary, and why there be such changes in the
future? Progress has been made in projecting the trend and mean
state of NHLMR in the warming climate4,17–21. The NHLMR is
projected to increase under Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP)
1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 using the Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models22,23. The rising
temperature in the future will increase atmospheric moisture,
resulting in the “wet gets wetter” pattern24 if the circulation
pattern remains little changed. However, future monsoons would
vary considerably from region to region20,25. The northern
hemisphere (NH) monsoon would significantly increase compared
to its southern hemisphere (SH) counterpart due to the “NH-
warmer than-SH” pattern induced by greenhouse gases (GHGs)
radiative forcing26. Furthermore, the GHGs forcing-induced “land-
warmer than-ocean” and the “El Niño-like” warming patterns will
amplify the differences between northern hemispheric regional
monsoons4,19,27. These two essential warming patterns might
particularly
contribute
to
the
different
circulation
changes
between the South and East Asian monsoons28. The fast land
warming and associated Tibetan Plateau thermal forcing would
strengthen the East Asian summer monsoon. In contrast, El Niño-
like oceanic warming would weaken the South Asian summer

El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) asymmetry in predictability on springtime initial condition remains unclear. From the
perspective of the spring predictability barrier (SPB), this paper investigates the ENSO asymmetry in SPB and explores the potential
factors that may lead to this asymmetry. Both the observation and 29 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6)
models show that the spring sea surface temperature (SST) persistence is significantly higher in El Niño years than that in La Niña
years, and the SPB intensity is stronger in La Niña years than that in El Niño years. Through the recharge oscillator model,
observation and CMIP6 models, we demonstrate that the nonlinear wind stress response to SST anomalies in spring is the main
cause of the asymmetric SPB intensity. By the mixed-layer heat budget of the tropical Pacific in the spring, we further identify that a
stronger response of zonal wind stress in El Niño events can cause a stronger zonal advection feedback, which finally leads to a
weaker SPB and enhances the predictability of El Niño. In contrast, the cooling SST in the spring only leads to weak easterly
anomalies, the zonal advection feedback is relatively weaker, thus SPB is stronger and the predictability of La Niña is lower. From
the perspective of SPB, we suggest that El Niño is more predictable than La Niña.","INTRODUCTION
El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the dominant mode of
interannual climate variability in the tropical Pacific. Its influence
has been identified to be worldwide1,2. Therefore, it is pivotal to
accurately predict ENSO as early as possible due to its tremendous
global impact. One major problem in ENSO predictability and
prediction is the well-known spring predictability barrier (SPB),
which is characterized by a band of maximum decline of monthly
predictability (e.g., indicated by autocorrelation) of sea surface
temperature (SST; e.g., Niño3.4) anomalies in the boreal spring3–5.
This maximum decline of ENSO predictability occurs in spring,
regardless of different initial months5,6. Since then, researchers
have begun to more focus on understanding the ENSO SPB7,8.
Including upper ocean temperatures in the initial conditions can
provide an additional skill to cross the boreal spring7. Other
aspects like westerly wind bursts in the prediction system also
significantly increase ENSO prediction skill and weaken the so-
called spring prediction barrier8. Nevertheless, the SPB is still an
obstacle for dynamical and statistical forecasting models even
with additional signals from the subsurface temperature in the
tropical Pacific9,10.
The asymmetric characteristic in ENSO predictability remains
unclear11.
Based
on
observational
ENSO
precursors,
some
studies suggested that El Niño is more predictable than La
Niña2. The similar conclusion through the ensemble forecast
experiments can be found in a perfect model framework12.
Alternatively, some studies demonstrated that strong La Niña
events are more predictable because they are mostly driven by
the thermocline feedback, while strong El Niño almost are driven
by stochastic wind forcing11,13. The western Pacific oceanic heat
content is a better predictor for La Niña than El Niño14. Recently,
some studies suggested that El Niño and La Niña events are
equally predictable through real-time seasonal ENSO forecasts
initialized by oceanic observations15. In addition, using Commu-
nity Earth System Model in a perfect model scenario, researchers
demonstrated that additional observations in the equatorial
regions may greatly improve El Niño predictions while the
observations in the off-equatorial regions around 10°N in the
central Pacific may be necessary to improve La Niña predic-
tions16. Although much efforts have been made to investigate
the predictability of El Niño and La Niña, the asymmetry of ENSO
predictability has not been explored from the perspective of
SPB. Particularly, we focus on the ENSO asymmetry in short-term
predictability on springtime initial condition.
Given that the nonlinear terms have been identified to play a
role in ENSO asymmetry13, these nonlinear terms may also be a
reason for ENSO asymmetry in SPB. ENSO nonlinear characteristic
of the amplitude, spatial pattern and time evolution are both
related to the nonlinear response of the zonal winds to SST
anomalies13,17. In addition, the nonlinear wind response to SST
plays a leading role in the genesis of ENSO asymmetry18. However,
the role of these terms is yet to be studied in the ENSO asymmetry
of predictability.
In this study, we aim to find the ENSO asymmetry of
predictability from the view of SPB and demonstrate the
possible mechanism to cause this asymmetry. We analyze the
SPB intensity of El Niño and La Niña years both in observation
and 29 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 models
(CMIP6). We then identify the key factors leading to SPB
asymmetry in the recharge oscillator model (ROM), observations
and CMIP6. A further analysis of the heat budget of the mix layer
in the tropical Pacific indicates the specific physical mechanism
to induce this asymmetry.

Oxygen isotope anomaly of nitrate aerosol (Δ17O-NO3−) contributes to understanding the atmospheric nitrogen chemistry in the
polar oceans. Here, Δ17O-NO3−of the aerosol samples was analyzed based on a cruise from East Asia to the Arctic Ocean to explore
the nitrate formation mechanisms. Δ17O-NO3−decreased with the increase of latitude, especially when after entering the Arctic
Circle. Δ17O-NO3−(e.g., 11.5‰–21.2‰) was extremely low while crossing the sea ice-covered Arctic Ocean. This is most likely
influenced by the combined enhancement of hydroxyl (OH) and peroxy (HO2 + RO2) radicals derived by sea ice under permanent
sunlight period. In addition, the obvious increase in the Δ17O-NO3−of return trip with shortened daytime indicated the advantage
of nocturnal pathways (NO3 related) with the higher Δ17O endmembers. The mutation of Δ17O-NO3−can reflect the change of NOx
conversion pathways to nitrate, and it can be more sensitive to the change of radical chemistry related to atmospheric oxidation.","INTRODUCTION
Atmospheric nitrate aerosols in polar regions can record changes
in atmospheric oxidation potential and greatly influence regional
atmospheric chemistry1,2, because the cycle of NOx and changes
in the formation pathway of nitrate aerosols affect the production
rate of O3 and the life of NOx3. Nitrates account for 75–100% of
nitrogen emissions deposited from the atmosphere in the Arctic
and Antarctic2. Numerous studies have well-studied the nitrate
formation pathways in terrestrial and coastal areas4–8. However,
due to observational restrictions and other limitations, the
formation mechanism of nitrate in the oceans, especially in the
Arctic Circle, is still unclear and needs to be further studied. Nitrate
impacts the oxidation capacity of the oceanic atmosphere9. In
addition, many free radical groups (e.g., HO2, RO2, OH, etc.) are
involved in the formation process of nitrate10. Nitrate is widely
recognized as an important factor for understanding the marine
geochemical cycle, especially to understand the atmospheric
oxidation related to reactive nitrogen11–13.
During the rapid cycle of NOx during the day, NO2 undergoes
photolysis and decomposes into NO and atomic oxygen, and then
O3 is generated after the atomic molecular oxygen combines with
molecular oxygen14. Tropospheric NO is mainly oxidized by O3
and HO2/RO2:
NO þ O3 ! NO2 þ O2
(1)
NO þ HO2=RO2 ! NO2 þ OH=OR
(2)
And oxidized halogen XO (X stands for Cl, Br, I) can also be the
oxides in certain conditions such as in the air above the open sea:
NO þ XO ! NO2 þ X
(3)
The conversion of NOx to HNO3 goes through a series of
complex pathways, generally including:
NO2 þ OH ! HNO3
(4)
NO2 þ O3 ! NO3 þ O2
(5)
NO3 þ HC=DMS ! HNO3 þ other product
(6)
NO2 þ NO3 ! N2O5
(7)
N2O5 þ H2O ! 2HNO3
(8)
Among them, dimethyl sulfide (DMS) are usually produced in
the ocean by phytoplankton15. Besides, although halogens can be
produced by coal combustion on land16,17, halogen chemistry
plays an important role in nitrate formation mainly in the oceans
and polar regions18,19:
NO2 þ XO þ M ! XONO2 þ M
(9)
XONO2 þ H2O ! HOX þ HNO3
(10)
The reaction relating to hydroxyl radical (OH) (Eq. (4)) takes
place during the day because the formation of OH requires
photolysis. Whereas, due to the photosensitivity of NO3 radicals,
the reaction with NO3 and N2O5 (Eqs. (6) and (8)) proceeds at
night. Halogen chemistry may be the main role of tropospheric
nitrate formation, especially in the oceanic atmosphere20.
Oxygen isotope anomaly (expressed as Δ17O = δ17O-0.52×δ18O) is
a powerful tool to reflect the mechanism involved in the formation
of nitrate, which contributes to a better understanding of the
atmospheric nitrogen cycle6,9,18,21,22. Different oxidants (O3, OH,

Due to the cold water temperatures, the East China Sea (ECS) is usually unfavorable for typhoon development. Recently, in a rare
event, Typhoon Bavi (2020) reached major typhoon status and became the strongest typhoon in the ECS in the past decade. Based
on in situ observations and model simulations, we discover that this typhoon is fueled by a marine heatwave, which creates a very
warm ocean condition with sea surface temperature (SST) exceeding 30 °C. Also, because of suppressed typhoon-induced SST
cooling caused by the shallow water depth (41 m) and strong salinity stratification (river runoff) within the ECS, the SST beneath the
typhoon remains relatively high and enhances the total heat flux for the typhoon. More interestingly, due to the fair weather ahead
of the typhoon, we find that the rapid development of this marine heatwave is likely, in part, attributed to the typhoon itself. As the
risks from typhoons and marine heatwaves are heightening under climate change, this study provides important insights into the
interaction between typhoons and marine heatwaves.","INTRODUCTION
In late August 2020, Typhoon Bavi unusually strengthened to
Category 3 on the Saffir-Simpson wind scale when it was traveling
up over the East China Sea (ECS) (Fig. 1), prompting North Korea to
live broadcast the status of this typhoon and issue one of the first
typhoon warnings in its history. Geographically, the ECS is a semi-
closed marginal sea located in the northwest portion of the
western North Pacific, where the water depth is generally <100 m.
With a lifetime maximum intensity of 100 knots (1 kt ≅0.51 m s−1
or 1.85 km h−1) attained at the southwest of Jeju Island, Typhoon
Bavi was one of the two strongest typhoons ever occurred in this
shallow water region. However, its intensity increase was the
largest in the ECS region, with a total increase of 25 kt (from 75 to
100 kt) in about 1.5 days. In fact, an intense typhoon like this is
extremely rare in the interior of the ECS, namely, at a latitude
higher than 30°N. According to the 30 years of typhoon best track
record1 during 1991–2020, only 6.7% (32 out of 480) of the
western North Pacific typhoons ended up in the ECS (Supple-
mentary Fig. 1). Yet most of these typhoons reached their lifetime
maximum intensity in the open western North Pacific Ocean, with
81.8% of them actually experiencing a decay over the ECS.
Moreover,
typhoons
that
achieved
their
lifetime
maximum
intensity, or what we may call here the “authentic” ECS typhoons,
merely account for 1.3% (i.e., only six typhoons) of the total
western North Pacific typhoons. This statistic truly reflects the fact
that in this ECS region, the atmospheric and oceanic environments
are both detrimental to typhoon development. Strong vertical
wind shears and sharp ocean temperature gradients are common
in the ECS2–6. Climatologically, the bottom water temperature in
this shallow basin can be as cold as 12 °C, which is due to the
spread of cold water sinking from the northern Yellow Sea in
winter time2,3. During summer, however, the ECS is highly
stratified by strong solar insolation, setting warm water on top
and rather cold water at the bottom. Given this hydrographical
condition, typhoons can easily generate excessive sea surface
temperature (SST) cooling, often up to 10 °C, in the ECS2–4,6. It is
well-known that typhoon-induced SST cooling is an essential
negative feedback in typhoon intensification. It can effectively
decrease
the
air–sea
temperature
disequilibrium
and
thus
significantly reduce or even reverse
the vital energy flux
transferring from the ocean to the typhoon7–21. Therefore, partially
because of strong SST cooling, the majority of typhoons tend to
decay in the ECS2.
Recent studies found that the shallow bathymetry near
continental coasts may play an essential role that may facilitate
the intensification of landfalling typhoons22,23. Induced by the
gusty winds, the vertical mixing is usually the primary mechanism
responsible for SST cooling beneath a typhoon7,11,13,15,16,23–29. In
general, the mixing depth (or length) of a typhoon, namely, the
water depth at which the typhoon forcing can reach, varies from
tens to 100 m or so, depending on ocean stratification and
typhoon characteristics such as wind speed, moving rate and
size4,13,16,21,25–27,30–32. A deeper typhoon mixing depth will usually
lead to stronger SST cooling since more cold water is being
entrained upward to the sea surface. However, in shallow waters,
regardless of how strong or slow the typhoon is or travels, the
maximum mixing depth will be capped by natural bathymetry. For
this reason, the typhoon-induced SST cooling would be signifi-
cantly suppressed or even vanish in shallow waters, eventually
boosting the typhoon intensity22,23. However, the magnitude of
SST cooling in shallow waters still largely depends on the
temperature structure of the water column. As in the ECS and
other continental shelf areas at similar latitudes, such as the Mid-
Atlantic Bight on the west side of the North Atlantic Ocean, the
pre-existing stron

The transitions of short-term trends of Indian Summer Monsoon daily precipitation extremes remain poorly understood. Here, we
show a short-term declination of temporal frequency of monsoonal precipitation extremes over Central India for the last 15 years
starting from 2005 to 2020 while the low and moderate events show increasing trends. The possible dynamical and
thermodynamical factors for the observed decline in precipitation extremes include depletion in moisture transport to Central India
via cross-equatorial flow and the low-level Somali jet, caused by reduced evaporation from the regional moisture sources. In
addition, the vertical gradient of the moist static energy exhibits favorable conditions for increased lower atmospheric stability,
supporting the declining trends. Lastly, the Atlantic Zonal Mode seems to be a potential large-scale climate driver for the less
frequent central Indian extreme rainfall events during 2005–2020.","INTRODUCTION
The most dominant modulators of the global climate in the recent
era have been the number of anthropogenically induced forcings,
causing climate change via global warming and the subsequent
alterations of the planetary hydroclimate1. Understanding the
climate responses through models and predictions faces many
difficulties, primary amongst those being the spatial heterogene-
ity2. Nowhere is it more challenging than in the tropics, where past
climate models have consistently had issues with matching the
observational rainfall data3, with its active water cycles4. The
global knowledge of the hydroclimate response has been geared
towards the warm-gets-wetter5,6 or the wet-gets-wetter7–9 schools
of thought in the tropics including the tropical monsoon regions.
Although it is expected that climate change will lead to increased
precipitation10–12, the ground reality has been quite different with
cases like the Indian Summer Monsoon rainfall (ISMR) exhibiting
an extended declining trend of mean precipitation for the period
between 1950 and 200213,14. Other studies have shown that ISMR
has a significant multi-decadal variability with the period between
60 and 70 years15–17 and the decreasing trend of ISMR from 1950
is a manifestation of a decreasing phase of the multi-decadal
variability. More recent study18 indicating a revival of ISMR to an
increasing trend from 2002 supports such a hypothesis that short-
term trends of ISMR are related to the multi-decadal variability.
The Indian Summer Monsoon is a convectively coupled system,
the large-scale winds are a result of a response to latent heat
source from monsoon rainfall while the convergence of moisture
by the same winds sustains and strengthens the rainfall. Therefore,
large-scale wind indices of Indian monsoon correlate significantly
with the seasonal precipitation19,20. However, due to the ‘internal’
variability of the convectively coupled system, this relationship is
not very strong21,22. Therefore, the multi-decadal variability of
ISMR is expected to also manifest in similar multi-decadal
variability in wind indices like the monsoon Hadley index or
low-level westerly jet (LLJ) index, etc. Further, as the extreme
rainfall events (EREs) are the results of convective instability on the
background mean monsoon condition, the multi-decadal varia-
bility of ISMR is expected to lead to multi-decadal variability of
statistics of EREs over the region. Some studies show that indeed
the daily EREs over Central India (CI) as well as over Northeast
India (NEI) have multidecadal variability21–23. Therefore, the short-
term trends of the EREs are largely a part of the multi-decadal
variability of the EREs. It has also been suggested that the changes
in land-use/land-cover patterns owing to urbanization and other
human-induced factors, along with regional thermodynamical,
dynamical, and convective parameters, are known to have
correlational and causal relationships with the ISM rainfall24.
Forewarning of the transition of trends of EREs such as from a
decreeing to an increasing is of great interest for disaster
preparedness planning but a long-range prediction remains
challenging due to the ‘chaotic’ nature of the climate system.
Here, we identify such a transition from decreasing trend to an
increasing trend of EREs in recent history and investigate the
potential drivers for this transition with the hope that findings will
help develop a long-lead prediction of statistics of the EREs.
The major precipitation regimes (based on the intensity) at CIR,
include Light Rainfall Events (0 < LREs ≤5 mm/day), Moderate
Rainfall Events (5 mm/day < MREs ≤100 mm/day), High Rainfall
Events (100 mm/day < HREs ≤150 mm/day), and Extreme Rainfall
Events (150 mm/day < EREs)25. Among these regimes, LREs and
MREs are fruitful to the human population as these feed the
agriculture in the region, whereas HREs and EREs are often
associated with the destruction of properties and livelihoods26,27.

A large fraction of the uncertainty around future global warming is due to the cooling effect of aerosol-liquid cloud interactions,
and in particular to the elusive sign of liquid water path (LWP) adjustments to aerosol perturbations. To quantify this adjustment,
we propose a causal approach that combines physical knowledge in the form of a causal graph with geostationary satellite
observations of stratocumulus clouds. This allows us to remove confounding influences from large-scale meteorology and to
disentangle counteracting physical processes (cloud-top entrainment enhancement and precipitation suppression due to aerosol
perturbations) on different timescales. This results in weak LWP adjustments that are time-dependent (first positive then negative)
and meteorological regime-dependent. More importantly, the causal approach reveals that failing to account for covariations of
cloud droplet sizes and cloud depth, which are, respectively, a mediator and a confounder of entrainment and precipitation
influences, leads to an overly negative aerosol-induced LWP response. This would result in an underestimation of the cooling
influence of aerosol-cloud interactions.","INTRODUCTION
Aerosols are airborne particles that modify the planetary radiative
budget, either directly, by absorbing or scattering radiation, or
indirectly, by acting as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) for the
formation of cloud droplets and subsequently modifying the
albedo of clouds1. Between pre-industrial times and 2019,
anthropogenic aerosol emissions caused a negative effective
radiative forcing (ERF) of −1.1[−1.7; −0.4] W m−22, thereby
offsetting part of the global warming induced by greenhouse
gases. The exact magnitude of the aerosol-induced cooling is hard
to quantify, with large uncertainties originating from the under-
standing of aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI). Liquid stratocumulus
clouds particularly contribute to this uncertainty because of their
moderately high albedo (≈40%) and extensive coverage in
oceanic regions with high insolation3,4. In liquid clouds, ERFACI is
a combination of the instantaneous Twomey effect and rapid
adjustments of cloud macrophysical properties, namely liquid
water path (LWP) and cloud fraction (CF)1. The Twomey effect
describes how, at an initially constant LWP, an increase in the
cloud droplet number concentration (Nd, used as a proxy for
aerosol concentrations) will cause a decrease in the effective cloud
droplet radius (reff5) but an increase in the total cloud droplet
surface area and therefore an increase in cloud albedo6. This initial
change in Nd can later trigger LWP adjustments (∂ln LWP
∂ln Nd ), which are
hard to constrain because they result from the superposition of
two counteracting physical processes. On the one hand, a
decrease in reff leads to precipitation suppression and subsequent
increases in LWP and cloud albedo7. On the other hand, increased
droplet concentrations and smaller radii will lead to suppressed
droplet sedimentation and enhanced radiative cooling at the top
of the cloud, thereby driving turbulence and entrainment of warm
(and dry) air from the free troposphere into the cloud. This leads
to evaporation of the smaller droplets, enhanced evaporative
cooling and even stronger entrainment, resulting in decreases in
LWP and cloud albedo8–12. Precipitation suppression and cloud-
top entrainment enhancement are difficult to disentangle as these
two processes occur simultaneously and they both involve a
feedback loop between cloud microphysical properties and
dynamical processes. This is illustrated in Fig. 1a.
The sign and magnitude of LWP adjustments depend on
temporal and spatial scales, cloud regimes and environmental
conditions, making it hard to interpret mere correlations as causal
effects of aerosols on clouds. The main difficulty consists in
removing confounding, i.e. the effect that a variable Z (e.g. an
environmental factor) has on both a cause-variable X (e.g. aerosol
properties) and an effect-variable Y (e.g. cloud properties), thereby
inducing a spurious correlation between X and Y. Ideally, causality
is inferred from randomized controlled trial experiments. Unfortu-
nately, this is rarely feasible in the field of Earth sciences. A good
alternative are the so-called opportunistic experiments (e.g. ship
tracks or volcano eruptions)13–15, or the use of climate models to
simulate the response of the climate system to a given forcing
while keeping all other forcings constant (i.e. evaluating counter-
factual climate scenarios)16. However, opportunistic experiments
and model simulations have drawbacks, especially when it comes
to representativity, or to computational cost for simulations. For
this reason, many studies use non-opportunistic observational
data, and in particular, satellite observations that have represen-
tative coverage in both time and space.
Previous ACI studies have tried to explicitly identify and remove
sources of confounding in observational data, such as the
confounding effect of relative humidity (RH) on CF adjustments17,
or the confounding effect of rainfall on convective cloud
invigoration18. Methods from causal inference

Hail damage is a leading cause of insured losses in Australia, but changes in this hazard have not been robustly quantified. Here, we
provide a continental-scale analysis of changes in hail hazard in Australia. A hail proxy applied to reanalysis data shows that from
1979–2021 annual hail-prone days decreased over much of Australia but increased in some heavily populated areas. For example,
the annual number of hail-prone days increased by ~40% around Sydney and Perth, the largest cities on Australia’s east and west
coasts, respectively. Changes in atmospheric instability have driven the trends. Radar observations, while covering shorter time
spans and a more limited area than the reanalysis, corroborate the broad pattern of results. This study shows consistent hail-
frequency trends in radar indicators and atmospheric environments and demonstrates substantial increases in hail frequency in
major Australian cities where hail impacts are most significant.","INTRODUCTION
Hail is a major meteorological hazard in Australia, with single hail
events capable of inflicting insured losses of over AUD $1b1–3. The
Australian cities of Sydney, Brisbane and Canberra have all been
affected by billion-dollar hailstorm events (normalised to 2017
dollars)4, and from 2014 to 2021, the seven most costly hailstorms
in Australia caused a total of AUD $7.4b in insured losses3.
Anthropogenic climate change is expected to affect hailstorms,
yet the exact nature of the changes remains stubbornly difficult to
quantify and therefore highly uncertain in Australia and across the
globe5. Australia is sparsely populated, and hail reports and radar
observations of hailstorms are generally restricted to more
populated regions1,6, frustrating efforts to quantify past and
expected future changes to hailstorms across the whole Australian
landmass. Here, we combine a hail proxy with radar observations
to provide detailed continental estimates of recent trends in hail-
hazard frequency in Australia.
Hail occurs under particular conditions inside of thunderstorms.
Not any storm will do: hail forms only when there is sufficient
supercooled liquid water to freeze onto the outside of embryo ice
particles, when there is a strong enough updraught to support the
growing embryos and when the storm structure allows the embryos
to remain in the hail-growth region for sufficient time to grow larger
than 5 mm in diameter7. Wind shear (changes in horizontal wind
speed and direction with height) influences storm structure and the
trajectory of a growing hailstone within the storm, so it is an
important influence on the size the hailstone can attain8,9. Wind
shear is required for the formation of supercell storms, the type of
thunderstorm most likely to produce damaging hail10. To reach the
ground as hail, hailstones must be sufficiently large to survive
melting as they fall through warmer air11.
Based on these physical processes, there are, globally, three
main expected effects of anthropogenic climate change on
hailstorms5. First, atmospheric instability is expected to increase
owing to increased saturation deficit in a warmer atmosphere12,
affecting storm initiation and leading to stronger updraughts that
can produce larger hailstones. Second, the melting-level height, at
which the wet-bulb temperature is 0 °C, is higher in a warmer
atmosphere13. A higher melting-level height implies more melting
of falling hailstones and allows only the larger hailstones to
survive, eliminating surface hail14 or increasing the mean hailstone
size15. Third, overall vertical wind shear is expected to decrease10.
A decrease in wind shear would normally be expected to reduce
hailstorm intensity10, but the situation is complicated because
local changes in wind shear may differ at times when hailstorms
occur16,17. Combining these offsetting factors, the broad expecta-
tion is that under climate change, surface hail may become less
frequent due to increased melt but more severe owing to
increased hailstone size at the ground5. However, observations
and simulated projections show that this expectation does not
hold everywhere, with strong geographical inhomogeneity in
climate responses and the resulting effects on hailstorms5.
Hailstorms are notoriously difficult to observe and model
because they are small-scale and relatively rare phenomena5. In
locations
where

environment-based hail proxies are often the best tool for
estimating the probability of hail occurrence5,10. Such hail proxies
use an “ingredients-based” approach18 to take information on the
large-scale atmospheric environment and, from it, estimate the
probability of hail reaching the surface: they commonly use some
combination of measures of instability and wind shear6,19,20. A
summary of such hail proxies, and other proxy ingredients and
methods that have been used, is given in previous work20. A

Fengyun Luo1,2, Jun Ying2,3✉, Tongya Liu2,3 and Dake Chen1,2,3✉
The warm sea surface temperature (SST) bias in the Southern Ocean (SO) has persisted in several generations of Coupled Model
Inter-comparison Project (CMIP) models, yet the origins of such a bias remain controversial. Using the latest CMIP6 models, here we
find that the warm SST bias in the SO features a zonally oriented non-uniform pattern mainly located between the northern and
southern fronts of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. This common bias is not likely to be caused by the biases in the surface heat
flux or the strength of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) — the two previously suggested sources of the SO
bias based on CMIP5 models. Instead, it is linked to the robust common warm bias in the Northern Atlantic deep ocean through the
AMOC transport as an adiabatic process. Our findings indicate that remote oceanic biases that are dynamically connected to the SO
should be taken into account to reduce the SO SST bias in climate models.","INTRODUCTION
Characterized by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC)—a
dominant part of the global thermohaline
circulation—the
Southern Ocean (SO) plays a unique and key role in the global
climate system1–3. It not only zonally connects three ocean basins
—the Pacific, the Atlantic, and the Indian Ocean, but also vertically
links the sea surface temperature (SST) with the ocean interior by
bringing up deep water through the westerly wind-driven
divergence. Normally, the deep water in the SO, consisting of
the Northern Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) of high salinity and
high oxygen concentration, upwells along the isopycnal1,4 to the
sea surface5. One part of the surface flow travels northward to
form the Subantarctic Mode Water and Antarctic Intermediate
Water (AAIW), while the other moves southward and sinks to be
part of the Antarctic Bottom Water6. The SO dynamics is critical in
anthropogenic carbon and heat uptake and in redistributing
global energy7–9. Therefore, understanding the basic state of the
SO is among the most important tasks in climate change research.
As sustained SO observations of are lacking10, numerical simula-
tions based on coupled climate models are an indispensable and
essential way to study the SO.
However, the SO has persistently suffered a systematic warm
SST bias in several generations of climate models participating in
the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIP)11–13. This
warm bias appears as one of the most prominent biases in global
SST modeling12, precluding correct simulations of the current
climate such as the location of the inter-tropical convergence
zone14, the recent trend of the Southern Annual Mode (SAM)15,
and the response of SO SST to SAM16. Moreover, it also lowers the
reliability of model projections for future climate change17.
A few previous studies have proposed possible causes of the SO
warm SST bias in CMIP models. For instance, ref. 12 found in a large
set of CMIP5 models, that the models with a weaker Atlantic
Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) tend to have warmer
SST in the SO, and thus the common SO warm SST bias can be
attributed to an overly weak AMOC strength. In contrast, ref. 18
revealed an extremely weak inter-model correlation between the
AMOC strength and the SO SST among CMIP5 models. Instead,
they found the surface shortwave radiation is more responsible for
the diversified simulations of SO SST and claimed that the warm
SST bias in the SO is primarily caused by the overestimation of
cloud-related
shortwave
radiation.
These
two
contradictory
explanations obscure a clear judgment of the true source of the
common SO warm SST bias.
The warm SST bias anchored in the SO is still prevailing in the
latest sixth phase of CMIP (CMIP6) models (Fig. 1a), and the
magnitude of such a bias is comparable to those in the previous
generations of CMIP models11,12, even though there are generally
higher spatial resolutions and more reasonable physical para-
meterizations in CMIP6 models than in their predecessors19.
Moreover, the bias of surface downward shortwave radiation has
been revealed to be largely remediated20 and the AMOC has been
shown to be reasonably simulated21,22 in CMIP6 models. All these
raise a natural question: are the causes suggested to be
responsible for the common SO warm SST bias among CMIP5
models still working in CMIP6 models? If not, what are the origins
of this persistent common warm SST bias in CMIP6 models?
RESULTS
SST bias in the SO
The CMIP6 multi-model mean (MMM) SST bias in the SO displays a
zonally nonuniform band-like warm pattern (Fig. 1a). The warm
biases are more robust and consistent in the Indian and Atlantic
Ocean sectors and weaker in the Pacific Ocean sector, which are
similar to the zonal distributions of the common SO warm SST bias
in the CMIP3 and CMIP5 models (see Fig. 5a in ref. 11 and Fig. 1a in
ref. 12, respectively). Overlaying the observed circumpolar Sub-

Tropical cyclone (TC) rainfall is an important component of global precipitation. Based on a 22-year satellite-based record of
observed precipitation from 1998 to 2019, we find that composite rainfall rates averaged within 500 km of TCs have increased.
However, the background precipitation rate in the TC-affected regions has also increased. Therefore we find, by subtracting the
background increase in precipitation rate from the TC precipitation composite, that TC precipitation rates--relative to the
background--have decreased, and that TC-related extreme precipitation rates near the TC center have also decreased. Besides TC
intensity and environmental sea surface temperature, the TC-induced sea surface cooling, typically formed like a cold wake feature,
is indicated to be a potentially important contributor to TC rainfall changes. The cold wake diminishes the upward transport of
surface enthalpy flux and leads to a decrease of moisture in the boundary layer, being unfavorable for the rainfall. The relative
decreasing rainfall trend of TCs to the background is therefore attributed to the strengthening sea surface cooling induced by TCs.
The TC-ocean interaction is suggested to be fully resolved in state-of-the-art global and regional climate models in order to improve
TC rainfall simulations and projections.","INTRODUCTION
The rainfall of tropical cyclones (TCs) is an important component
of global precipitation1,2. Resultant freshwater flooding is among
the most severe threats to human lives and socioeconomic
losses3–5. This highlights the necessity of improving the current
understanding and prediction skills of TC rainfall. Nonetheless,
there are still large uncertainties in the characteristics of TC rain
rate, which are modulated simultaneously not only by internal
factors such as intensity, translation speed, and asymmetry of
TCs6–9, but also by environmental parameters such as sea surface
temperature (SST), humidity and atmospheric stability, etc.8,10–13.
There is a robust increasing trend of global precipitation under
warmer climates14,15. As inferred from the Clausius-Clapeyron
relation, the atmosphere can hold more water vapor at higher
temperatures, corresponding to a rate of ~7% per degree Celsius.
As such, most global and regional climate models have projected
increased TC rain rates with global warming16–20, wherein Knutson
et al.17 noted that the rain rate within 100 km of the storm center
may increase on the order of 20% by 2100. The availability of
global satellite observations can provide clues for the robustness
of model predictions. In combination with the Tropical Rainfall
Measuring Mission (TRMM) product and global atmospheric
model simulations, Lin et al.13 found that although TC rain rate
increases with increasing absolute SST, the rainfall area is
dominantly controlled by relative SST. Based on a 19-year time
series of observational data, Guzman and Jiang21 suggested a
remarkably increasing trend of TC rain rate by ~1.3% per year,
which
is
nonetheless
attributed
to
a
combined
effect
of
decreasing inner-core rainfall and increasing rain rate in the
rainband region. The decreasing trend of inner-core rain rate of
TCs is highlighted in Tu et al.22, which indicated that the TC rain
rate decreases by ~1.2% per year within ~100–125 km from the
storm center. Consequently, the overall increasing trend of TC
system is about 0.4% per year, being much lower than that
reported by Guzman and Jiang21. Whatever the quantitative
discrepancies in previous work, the observed decreasing trend of
TC rainfall in the inner core contradicts the steadily increasing TC
rainfall by model projections. There could be important physical
processes that occur in the real world but are not resolved in
climate models, as also cautioned by Knutson et al.17.
TCs are strongly rotating systems with intense inertial stability in
the inner core that protects the TCs from possible environmental
influences23,24. Since the decreasing trend of TC rain rate is most
significant near the storm center, diminishing radially outward
monotonically (Fig. 1a, b), the dominant contributor should be
capable of affecting TC inner core directly, such as the sea surface
cooling (SSC) underlying a translating TC. Under global warming,
the sea surface warms at a greater rate than the subsurface water,
causing a strengthening of upper-ocean stratification25. This
contributes to a significant increase in global TC-induced SSC26.
The enhanced cold wakes by TCs have offset a small part of TC
intensity increase under global warming conditions27,28, while
their effect on TC precipitation remains unclear. The contribution
of SSC to TC rainfall will be examined in this study, with a
comparison to the background rainfall. For each TC location, a
square domain with widths of 20° centered around the TC center
is used to derive TC rainfall; the background rainfall is derived
using the same domain, but with the precipitation data shifted
from one year before. Therefore, the background rainfall covers a
time period one year shorter than TC rainfall (see section 4 for
more details). We will demonstrate in this study that there is a net
decreasing rainfall trend of TCs relative to their background
environment and that it is the strengthened SSC that leads to the
relative decrease of T

The US Southwest is in a drought crisis that has been developing over the past two decades, contributing to marked increases in
burned forest areas and unprecedented efforts to reduce water consumption. Climate change has contributed to this ongoing
decadal drought via warming that has increased evaporative demand and reduced snowpack and streamflows. However, on the
supply side, precipitation has been low during the 21st century. Here, using simulations with an atmosphere model forced by
imposed sea surface temperatures, we show that the 21st century shift to cooler tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures forced a
decline in cool season precipitation that in turn drove a decline in spring to summer soil moisture in the southwest. We then project
the near-term future out to 2040, accounting for plausible and realistic natural decadal variability of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans
and radiatively-forced change. The future evolution of decadal variability in the Pacific and Atlantic will strongly influence how wet
or dry the southwest is in coming decades as a result of the influence on cool season precipitation. The worst-case scenario involves
a continued cold state of the tropical Pacific and the development of a warm state of the Atlantic while the best case scenario
would be a transition to a warm state of the tropical Pacific and the development of a cold state of the Atlantic. Radiatively-forced
cool season precipitation reduction is strongest if future forced SST change continues the observed pattern of no warming in the
equatorial Pacific cold tongue. Although this is a weaker influence on summer soil moisture than natural decadal variability, no
combination of natural decadal variability and forced change ensures a return to winter precipitation or summer soil moisture levels
as high as those in the final two decades of the 20th century.","INTRODUCTION
Drought is no stranger to the southwest of the United States. The
region has undergone dramatic fluctuations in aridity during the
instrumental period and over the last millennium1–4. However, the
regional population grew more rapidly than the US as a whole for
every decade of the post World War II era (see https://

southwest-continues.html). Rapid growth in the last two decades
of the 20th century was coincident with one of the wettest periods
of the last millennium4. The current drought, which began around
1998/995,6 is occurring in the presence of a large and growing
population, an agriculture system that is a critical part of the US
and global food supply and uses most of the region’s surface
water, and, due to rising greenhouse gases, a climate warmer than
any in the history of water resource development. Warming
increases atmospheric evaporative demand and can potentially
reduce soil moisture and streamflows7–9. It can also dry vegetation
and help explain the stark increases in burned forest areas in the
West10. The confluence of an extended period of reduced
precipitation and warming temperatures, rising population, and
intensive agricultural water use are producing unprecedented
stress on western agriculture and water resources (ref.
11,12,
 despite suc-
cessful efforts to reduce water consumption. The expansion of
forest fires only adds to the sense of a climate, resources and
habitability crisis.
The obvious questions from both climatological and social
impacts perspectives are: What is causing the drought? Is it natural
variability, forced change or some mix? When will it end and what
will the future be like? In terms of human-induced change,
warming will continue and climate models project a reduction in
winter precipitation in Mexico and the far southwestern US and a
robust drying across the West coast in spring13–15 driven by
enhanced dry zonal moisture advection16. However, in terms of
natural variability, the wet period in the last two decades of the
20th century occurred in association with the warm tropical Pacific
phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO)17–19, and the
following 21st century megadrought has been related to the cool
phase that began following the 1997/98 El Niño (e.g.6,20–23) thus
illustrating the connection between the cool phase of the PDO
and southwestern megadrought24. The Atlantic Multidecadal
Oscillation (AMO), which has been in a warm phase since the
mid-1990s, can also drive drought variability over western North
America25–28. Therefore, past and future precipitation in the
American Southwest depends on radiatively-forced change and
how the PDO and AMO evolve.
Investigating decadal variability, forced change, and impacts on
precipitation over land is not easy with state-of-the-art coupled
models such as those within the Large Ensembles29 and the latest
generation Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 630. Though
some models can realistically simulate some aspects of the
internally generated Pacific decadal variability31,32, others do not
simulate the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans with high degrees of
realism of spatial and temporal variability33,34. Even if models are
able to simulate realistic internal decadal variability this would
only line up in time with the observed variability by chance
presenting challenges to model-data comparisons over the
historical period. Further, the tropical Pacific Ocean exerts a
strong control on North America cool season precipitation and it

The monsoons in Pakistan have been exceptionally harsh in recent decades, resulting in extraordinary drought conditions and
record flooding events. The changing characteristics of extreme events are widely attributed to climate change. However, given this
region’s long history of floods and droughts, the role of natural climate variability cannot be rejected without a careful diagnosis.
Here, we examine how oceanic and atmospheric variability has contributed to unusual precipitation distributions in West South
Asia. Variations in sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific and northern Arabian Sea, and internal atmospheric variability
related to the circumglobal teleconnection pattern and the subtropical westerly jet stream, explain more than 70% of monthly
summer precipitation variability in the 21st century. Several of these forcings have co-occurred with record strength during
episodes of extreme monsoons, which have exacerbated the overall effect. Climate change may have contributed to increased
variability and the in-phase co-occurrences of the identified mechanisms, but further research is required to confirm any such
connection.","INTRODUCTION
Pakistan has experienced frequent extreme monsoon events in
recent decades. At the turn of the century, Pakistan was exposed
to one of the most severe droughts in its history1,2, while the
floods of 2010 and 2022 were among the most devastating in
modern times3,4. Considering West South Asia (WSA; 65°–75E° and
24°–37N°), the number of months with standardized precipitation
anomalies exceeding ±1 has increased by a factor of ~1.4 between
1979–2000
and
2001–2022,
while
the
number
of
months
exceeding ±1.5 has increased by a factor of 3.5 (Fig. 1). The large
variations in the summer monsoon over WSA make a compelling
case for climate change. However, despite the apparent increase
in monsoon extremes, floods and droughts in this region predate
modern climate change5,6. An attribution study also suggests the
role of naturally occurring processes as anthropogenic forcing
alone cannot explain the observed intensity of precipitation
extremes7. Therefore, it is essential to investigate these recent
changes in the historical context to delineate the role of natural
climate variability in driving such anomalies.
Although
a
substantially
stronger
(weaker)
South
Asian
monsoon can significantly enhance (reduce) summer precipitation
over WSA, the remarkably wet conditions experienced in the
northwestern and southern Pakistan regions in recent years are
extraordinarily unusual. These areas lie at the boundary of the
South Asian monsoon and are usually beyond the reach of the
most energetic weather systems capable of producing significant
precipitation. The dry entrainment in the lower atmosphere, the
strong
westerlies
in
the
upper
atmosphere
over
WSA
(Supplementary Fig. 1), and the low heat budget in the adjacent
Arabian Sea make conditions unfavorable for rain-producing
weather systems8. Several factors – such as atmospheric wave
activity triggered by distant teleconnections, circumglobal wave
patterns, or jet stream anomalies – can overcome this unfavorable
background environment and provide conditions conducive to
above-normal monsoons9–12. However, it is yet to be determined
how much of a role these factors have played in recent extremes.
Many of Pakistan’s extreme monsoons have happened during
years with anomalous sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the
equatorial Pacific in connection with the phenomenon known as
the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The most notable are
droughts in 1997, 2002, and 2004 during El Niño (positive ENSO)
and floods in 2010, 2011, and 2022 during La Niña (negative
ENSO) (Fig. 1). Nevertheless, the monthly teleconnection of ENSO
forcing on WSA summer precipitation is weak: not only is the
severity of extreme monsoon conditions in Pakistan not propor-
tional to the strength of ENSO forcing, but in several cases, the
negative teleconnection even breaks downs. For instance, drought
persisted in Pakistan even with extreme La Niña conditions during
1998–1999; likewise, despite strong El Niño, seasonal monsoon
precipitation was average in 2015. This implies that other
contributing factors, such as co-occurrences of other modes of
variability, compensate for or compound the impact of ENSO.
Evidence suggests that jet stream meandering in the Northern
Hemisphere may be one of the contributors to WSA precipitation
variability11–14. On average, the subtropical westerly jet lies north
of South Asia during the monsoon season (Supplementary Fig. 1).

Strong, ongoing high-latitude warming is causing changes to vegetation composition and plant productivity, modifying plant
emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs). In the sparsely populated high latitudes with clean background air,
climate feedback resulting from BVOCs as precursors of atmospheric aerosols could be more important than elsewhere on the
globe. Here, we quantitatively assess changes in vegetation composition, BVOC emissions, and secondary organic aerosol (SOA)
formation under different climate scenarios. We show that warming-induced vegetation changes largely determine the spatial
patterns of future BVOC impacts on SOA. The northward advances of boreal needle-leaved woody species result in increased SOA
optical depth by up to 41%, causing cooling feedback. However, areas with temperate broad-leaved trees replacing boreal needle-
leaved trees likely experience a large decline in monoterpene emissions and SOA formation, causing warming feedback. We
highlight the necessity of considering warming-induced vegetation shifts when assessing land radiative feedback on climate
following the BVOC-SOA pathway.","INTRODUCTION
The northern high latitudes are experiencing stronger warming
than the global average and this warming is reflected in observed
changes to vegetation composition, plant traits, and plant
productivity1,2, which could profoundly alter the magnitude and
composition of plant-emitted biogenic volatile organic com-
pounds
(BVOCs)3.
Warming-induced
permafrost
thaw
could
release previously locked nutrients, abating nutrient limitations,
and thereby supporting enhanced plant productivity and growth
in this region4,5. The predicted increase in atmospheric CO2
concentrations might, however, inhibit BVOC production, so it
remains unclear how BVOC emissions might respond to the fast
and combined environmental changes in the high latitudes.
Constitutive BVOC emissions from plants are dominated by
terpenoids6, with isoprene and monoterpene contributing to
~70% and ~11% of global total BVOC emissions, respectively7. The
production of both isoprene and terpenes is expected to increase
with temperature rise3. As terpenoid production is coupled with
plant photosynthesis, factors such as the availability of water,
nutrients, light, and atmospheric CO2 concentrations that influ-
ence plant photosynthetic rates, can indirectly impact BVOC
production. Plants growing under elevated CO2 concentrations
often show lower BVOC production (clear evidence for isoprene8,9,
but contrasting evidence for monoterpenes10–12). However, short-
term laboratory studies have shown that the CO2 inhibition of
isoprene production decreases at higher leaf temperatures13,14
and it is not well understood whether this pattern is sustainable in
the long-term. At landscape scales, BVOC emissions vary strongly
in space, depending on the plant species composition as well as
their emission profiles15. The projected increase in atmospheric
CO2 concentrations16, together with rising temperatures, will likely
stimulate plant productivity and thus, increase BVOC-emitting leaf
biomass, while simultaneously imposing varying degrees of
inhibition on BVOC production17 and altering spatial distributions
of high-latitude vegetation.
Plant-emitted
BVOCs
participate
in a
series
of
chemical
reactions in the atmosphere. The atmospheric lifetimes of the
dominant BVOCs range from minutes to hours18 and the reactivity
varies even within the same chemical group, depending on the
structure of the molecule and the oxidant it reacts with. Once
emitted into the air, these BVOCs, typically with the unsaturated
functional groups, are susceptible to oxidation by hydroxyl radical
(OH), ozone (O3) and nitrate radical (NO3)19. The major oxidation
pathway of isoprene is via OH since they have similar diurnal
variations. This pathway produces isoprene hydroxy peroxy radical
(ISOPOO) which can either be further oxidised to form semi and
extremely low-volatility organic compounds (SVOCs and ELVOCs)
to contribute to secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation20, or
undergo H-shift isomerization to recycle OH. The oxidation of
isoprene by O3 also produces SVOCs and ELVOCs, as well as other
organic peroxy radicals and small molecules19,20. Similarly, the
SOA precursors are also formed from the oxidation of mono-
terpenes by OH and O3 but with about one order of magnitude
larger yields than that of isoprene20. As NO3 is photolyzed rapidly,
the reactions of BVOCs with NO3 mainly occur during nighttime,
which produces organic nitrates, peroxy radicals, and subse-
quently oxidised compounds21. When isoprene and monoter-
penes coexist, isoprene can compete with monoterpenes to
consume OH and produce relatively more volatile products than
oxidation from monoterpenes. leading to suppressing SOA
formation22,23. This suppression effect could be important to

Obtaining the response of cloud top temperature (CTT) to global warming correctly is crucial for understanding the current and
future energy budget of the climate system. For a given cloud fraction, colder CTT implies more longwave radiation being capped
within the Earth-atmosphere system, consequently heating it. Current climate models predict an almost fixed CTT for upper-
tropospheric clouds as the climate is expected to warm up during the 21st century, as explained by the fixed anvil temperature
hypothesis. However, our analysis, based on the last 19 years of satellite observations (12.2002–11.2021), reveals a significant
decreasing trend in upper-tropospheric CTT with almost no change in the corresponding cloud fraction. This cooling rate is several
times larger than the observed surface warming rate. This finding suggests a missing heating component by upper-tropospheric
clouds in current climate predictions.","INTRODUCTION
Cloud top temperature (CTT) is a major climatic factor that,
together with the cloud fraction (CF), determines, to a large
extent, the thermal emission of the Earth-atmosphere system1.
Less longwave radiation escapes into space with colder CTT,
leading to more energy being trapped within the atmosphere,
hence heating it. A decreasing trend in CTT following global
warming indicates additional heating of the climate system, i.e.,
positive feedback2. Therefore, information about changes in CTT is
crucial for climate prediction. Numerous studies were dedicated to
exploring clouds’ response to a warmer climate. Among them,
current climate models suggest an almost fixed or slightly
increased top temperature of upper-tropospheric clouds2–4, as
explained by the fixed anvil temperature (FAT) hypothesis5 and
the proportionally higher anvil temperature (PHAT) hypothesis6.
This prediction has been identified as highly confident in the latest
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Assessment Report
(AR6) and has become well-accepted2.
The FAT hypothesis suggests that the temperature of tropical
anvils will not change under climate warming5. The physics
behind this hypothesis is based on the principles of the
tropospheric energy balance, the Clausius-Clapeyron relation,
and mass continuity7. To elaborate, clear-sky radiative cooling,
attributed mainly to longwave emission by water vapor, is
balanced
by
adiabatic
heating
through
subsidence5,7.
The
Clausius-Clapeyron equation relates the amount of water vapor,
and
hence
the
tropospheric
cooling
with
height,
to
the
temperature7,8. Above a certain level in the troposphere, where
the temperature is too cold to contain optically thick amounts of
water vapor, the cooling, and accompanying subsidence become
inefficient sharply (and hence weaker), leading to a strong clear-
sky convergence at this level5,7. Due to mass continuity, the strong
convergence is balanced by a strong cloudy-sky divergence.
Therefore, the anvils and cirrus clouds associated with it are
expected to form primarily at this isotherm level, independent of
surface warming5. The FAT hypothesis was later expanded to the
whole globe by demonstrating that the extratropical atmosphere
is controlled by similar fundamental physics9.
Although the
FAT hypothesis
includes
a
long
chain of
assumptions, its general idea is supported by simulations of
cloud-resolving models, e.g., ref. 10, and observations focusing on
inter-annual variations (e.g., the El Niño–Southern Oscillation,
ENSO)11,12. These studies agree with the constraint of radiative
cooling on anvils’ temperature and show its negligible response to
surface warming9–14. Following this understanding, the FAT
hypothesis was refined to the PHAT hypothesis to explain the
positive longwave cloud feedback predicted by most of the global
climate models (GCMs)6. The PHAT hypothesis suggests a slightly
increased upper-tropospheric CTT in a warmer climate by taking
into account the stronger static stability at higher levels of the
upper troposphere (i.e., the stronger the static stability, the weaker
the subsidence required to maintain energy balance)6. However,
there are also simulations7 and short-term observations (months
to years)15–18 indicating non-negligible changes in anvil tempera-
ture with respect to the changes in surface temperature.
Additionally, global warming has led to other substantial global
changes besides the surface temperature, such as humidity19.
Direct, long-term observational evidence supporting the FAT or
PHAT hypotheses, or disproving them, is still missing20,21.
Here, to explore the trend in upper-tropospheric CTT, we
performed a detailed, almost global (60° S–60° N) analysis on 19
years of daily measurements (12.2002–11.2021) by the MODerate

Existing methods for fine-scale air quality assessment have significant gaps in their reliability. Purely data-driven methods lack any
physically-based mechanisms to simulate the interactive process of air pollution, potentially leading to physically inconsistent or
implausible results. Here, we report a hybrid multilevel graph neural network that encodes fluid physics to capture spatial and
temporal dynamic characteristics of air pollutants. On a multi-air pollutant test in China, our method consistently improved
extrapolation accuracy by an average of 11–22% compared to several baseline machine learning methods, and generated
physically consistent spatiotemporal trends of air pollutants at fine spatial and temporal scales.","INTRODUCTION
Air pollution has major adverse effects on health and climate.
Recent research1 shows that in 2018 more than 8 million people
died from acute and chronic respiratory diseases, lung cancer,
stroke and heart disease related to fossil fuel pollution, indicating
a much greater burden than suggested in previous studies2.
Globally, air pollution plays a crucial but complex role in Earth’s
climate and ecosystems3. Similar to the demand for high-
resolution climate model estimates, reliable and finely-resolved
air pollution estimates are needed to accurately evaluate its
effects on humans and ecosystems at regional and local scales,
and to inform effective control strategies4. Air pollutant concen-
trations can vary sharply over short spatial distances due to
unevenly distributed emissions sources, meteorological transport
dynamics and complex secondary chemical processes5, particu-
larly in extreme air quality events6.
Despite advances in mechanistic and statistical modeling,
predicting fine-scale concentration gradients remains a challenge
due to sparsely distributed measurement data, difficulty in
characterizing complex atmospheric physiochemical processes,
and
modeling
limitations7.
For
mechanism-based
methods
including dispersion, photochemical and plume models, issues
such as missing and noisy input data (e.g., insufficient or outdated
emission inventories), ill-posed boundary conditions, and complex
accumulative parameterizations may lead to high uncertainties for
many fine-scale local applications5,8. Statistics-based machine
learning methods solely rely on the empirical statistical associa-
tions between air pollutant concentrations and explanatory
factors
to
make
predictions.
However,
the
formation
and
transformation of air pollutants involves varying emission sources,
atmospheric transport and physiochemical reactions within the
planetary boundary layer, which are also affected by altitude,
surrounding land characteristics and local geography4,9. These
features cannot be well captured by classical statistical or machine
learning techniques. Furthermore, while statistical methods have
reported improved predictive performance, they may produce
physically inconsistent or implausible results10 due to sampling
bias, lack of physical constraints, and/or confounding effects
arising from spatially stratified heterogeneous processes11. These
issues may be amplified given that models are often tested by
taking random samples across space and time for validation,
which does not provide accurate generalizable performance
statistics when applying the model to make predictions at
unobserved spatial locations. To improve upon these limitations,
machine learning has been combined with climate or atmospheric
chemistry models to speed up computation or improve prediction
accuracy, by replacing time-consuming mechanism components
(e.g., chemical integrator)12,13, memorizing the input-output
relationship in mechanism models14, correcting the bias15 or
representing subgrid process16. Furthermore, there has been a
growing trend of integrating physical knowledge into deep
learning techniques to model fluid fields, incorporating constraints
such as partial differential equations (PDE)17,18, yet apart from few
limited applications19,20 there continue to be gaps in effective
strategies for embedding physics in deep learning to improve
finely-resolved air quality assessments.
Here, we report a flexible deep graph hybrid modeling (DGM)
approach (Fig. 1) incorporating fluid physics21 in deep learning to
capture spatiotemporal interactions of air pollutants, encoding
their dynamic characteristics and transport at fine scales to
improve spatiotemporal predictions. We are motivated by the
applicability of deep graph learning to encode neighborhood
information that represents the dynamics of air pollutants9, and
physical invariance to guide optimization17. For irregular non-
Euclidean data with limited measurements, such as monitoring

Over the past half-century, there has been an increasing trend in the magnitude and duration of the Madden-Julian Oscillation
(MJO) attributable to the significant warming trend in the Western Pacific (WP). The MJO, bridging weather and climate, influences
global and regional climate through atmospheric teleconnections, and climate models can predict it for up to 4–5 weeks. In this
study, we use deep learning (DL) methods to investigate the predictability of the MJO-related western Pacific precipitation on a
multi-month time scale (5–9 weeks). We examine numerous potential predictors across the tropics, selected based on major MJO
theories and mechanisms, to identify key factors for long-term MJO prediction. Our results show that DL-based useful potential
predictability of the WP precipitation can be extended up to 6–7 weeks, with a correlation coefficient skill ranging from 0.60 to 0.65.
Observational and heat map analysis suggest that cooling anomalies in the central Pacific play a crucial role in enhancing westerly
anomalies over the Indian Ocean and warming in the WP, thereby strengthening the Walker circulation in the equatorial Pacific. In
addition, the predictability of WP precipitation is higher in La Nina years than in El Nino or normal years, suggesting that mean
cooling in the central Pacific may contribute to increased predictability of the MJO-related WP precipitation on the multi-month
time scale. Additional model experiments using observed sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies over the central Pacific
confirmed that these anomalies contribute to enhanced MJO-related convective anomalies over the WP. The study highlights that
DL is a valuable tool not only for improving MJO-related WP prediction but also for efficiently exploring potential mechanisms
linked to long-term predictability.","INTRODUCTION
The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO)1 has a significant impact on
various aspects of tropical weather2–12, tropical cyclones7,8,
regional monsoons3,5,11,13, and the El Niño Southern Oscillation
(ENSO)14,15. Thanks to improvements in climate models and
international collaborative research, the latest climate models
participating in coupled model intercomparison project phase 6
(CMIP6) have a useful skill for MJO forecast up to 30-39 days in
advance16,17. However, the forecast skill at a longer lead time,
exceeding four weeks, remains relatively low due to systematic
model biases arising from a poor representation of MJO dynamics
and physics17,18. As anthropogenic global warming leads to the
expansion of the warm pool, there is potential for an increase in
MJO-related precipitation anomalies over the western Pacific (WP).
This suggests that extreme weather events induced by the MJO in
densely populated mid-latitude regions could be intensified6,19–22.
Hence, there is a growing need for improved sub-seasonal
forecasts at longer lead times, specifically for WP precipitation.
Deep Learning (DL) has emerged as a valuable tool in weather
and climate prediction23,24, as well as for model parameteriza-
tion25,
development
of
global
climate
model26,
and
post-
processing tasks for weather and climate prediction27,28. In this
study, we employ DL techniques to explore the predictability of
WP precipitation at lead times extending over several months. By
incorporating existing MJO theories and mechanisms, we aim to
deepen our understanding and improve our forecasting capabil-
ities in this crucial region.
In this study, we develop the DL model for the predictability of
MJO-related precipitation over the WP, and we demonstrate that
the DL model can extend predictability for MJO-related WP
precipitation at a longer lead time. Among many possible
predictors suggested by MJO theories, sea surface temperature
(SST) anomalies over the central and eastern Pacific (CP) play a key
role in extending long-term predictability through enhancing
MJO-related circulation. These results underscore that DL is a
valuable tool for efficiently uncovering the underlying mechan-
isms associated with weather and climate predictability and
improving prediction.
RESULT
Forecast skills of DL models
The state-of-the-art climate models have a limitation in predicting
MJO beyond one month and dominant processes or mechanisms
for leading the long-range MJO forecast with 5–9 weeks of lead time
remain unclear. To explore its long-term predictability and driving
mechanisms, we build a DL forecast system using various predictors
selected based on major MJO theories and mechanisms proposed.
Our DL model incorporates various atmospheric variables, including
precipitation, lower tropospheric specific humidity, zonal wind,
equivalent potential temperature, diabatic heating, zonal and

Mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) are a substantial source of precipitation in the eastern U.S. and may be sensitive to regional
climatic change. We use a suite of convection-permitting climate simulations to examine possible changes in MCS precipitation.
Specifically, annual and regional totals of MCS and non-MCS precipitation generated during a retrospective simulation are
compared to end-of-21st-century simulations based on intermediate and extreme climate change scenarios. Both scenarios
produce more MCS precipitation and less non-MCS precipitation, thus significantly increasing the proportion of precipitation
associated with MCSs across the U.S.","INTRODUCTION
Mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) and their precipitation are
important to regional hydroclimates and, thus, numerous aspects
of society1. Concerningly, MCS precipitation may be changing2,3,
and at a rate differing from other types of precipitation events4
(non-MCS precipitation). This is important because the character
MCS and non-MCS precipitation (e.g., rate, duration, areal cover-
age, etc.) are fundamentally different5–7 and produce contrasting
hydrological responses8 and societal impacts9,10. However, few
studies have examined future changes in MCS precipitation11, and
none have examined how MCS precipitation may change relative
to non-MCS precipitation due to the difficulties associated with
running convection-permitting regional climate models (CP-
RCMs12,13). Although CP-RCMs are necessary for properly simulat-
ing meso-gamma processes associated with deep, moist convec-
tion (including MCSs14), few CP-RCM climate change simulations
with sufficiently long study periods (e.g., ≥10 years) and domains
encompassing the conterminous United States (CONUS) exist15–19.
CP-RCMs are capable of decomposing
MCS and non-MCS
precipitation, and examining how these two categories of
precipitation respond to climate change scenarios will improve
our understanding of regional climate change in the central and
eastern CONUS1,20. Using a suite of simulations driven by a CP-
RCM19, we examine how MCS and non-MCS precipitation may
change relative to one another in two potential climate change
realizations.
PRECIPITATION IN A RETROSPECTIVE AND TWO END-OF-
CENTURY SIMULATIONS
We assess trends in MCS, non-MCS precipitation, and total (ALL)
precipitation using output from a CP-RCM for a retrospective
simulation (HIST; 1990–2005) and two end-of-21st-century (FUTR
4.5 and FUTR 8.5; 2085–2100) simulations. The spatial pattern of
MCS precipitation in HIST (Fig. 1b) is similar to observations21. MCS
precipitation accumulation in HIST maximizes over Louisiana and
decreases in step with distance from the Gulf of Mexico, while
non-MCS precipitation maximizes over parts of the Northeast
(Fig. 1c). For the eastern CONUS (ECONUS; Fig. 1a.i–v), the spatial
pattern of ALL precipitation is more correlated with non-MCS
precipitation than it is with MCS precipitation (rnon_mcs = 0.75;
rmcs = 0.66; p < 0.05). The difference in spatial correlation between
ALL precipitation and MCS and non-MCS precipitation is smallest
for the Southern Plains (rnon_mcs = 0.97; rmcs = 0.99; p < 0.05) and
largest for the Northeast (rnon_mcs = 0.91; rmcs = 0.40; p < 0.05).
Previous work examining MCS and non-MCS precipitation in
observational datasets reported similar findings4.
Two regimes of ALL precipitation trends exist in both FUTR 4.5
and FUTR 8.5 across the ECONUS, with increasingly dry years in
the central and southern Great Plains, and increasingly wet years
in the Midwest, Northeast, and Mid-South (Fig. 1d, g). This pattern
is also evident in MCS precipitation trends (Fig. 1e, h), except there
are more grids with significant increases. Conversely, non-MCS
precipitation decreases in both FUTR 4.5 and FUTR 8.5 for most
locations in the ECONUS (Fig. 1f, i). Consequently, the ratio of MCS
precipitation to ALL precipitation increases significantly over most
of the ECONUS for annual (Supplementary Fig. 1) and seasonal
periods (Supplementary Figs. 2, 3, 4, and 5) in FUTR 8.5, and over
smaller portions of the ECONUS in FUTR 4.5. The distribution of
regional means of annual precipitation in HIST, FUTR 4.5, and FUTR
8.5 for ALL events, MCS events, and non-MCS events further
illustrates these trends (Fig. 2). Generally, annual totals of ALL
precipitation stay the same (Fig. 2a), annual MCS precipitation
increases (Fig. 2b), annual non-MCS precipitation decreases
(Fig. 2c). As a result, the ratio of MCS to ALL precipitation
significantly increases for all regions in FUTR 8.5, and all but the
Northern Plains in FUTR 4.5 (Fig. 2b). Only one region, the
Southern Plains, e

It remains a major challenge to attribute heatwave’s lifecycle characteristics quantitatively to interwoven atmospheric and surface
actions. By constructing a process-resolving, energetics-based attribution framework, here we quantitatively delineate the lifecycle
of the record-breaking 2022 mega-heatwave over central-eastern China from a local energetics perspective. It is found that the
cloudlessness induced radiative heating and atmospheric dynamics dominate the total energy buildup during the developing
stage, while the land-atmosphere coupling and atmospheric horizontal advection act most effectively to sustain and terminate the
heatwave, respectively. A reduction in anthropogenic aerosols provides a persistent positive contribution during the event,
suggesting that pollution mitigation measures may actually increase the amplitudes of future heatwaves. With this framework,
initial efforts are made to unravel culprits in a model’s sub-seasonal prediction of this mega-heatwave, demonstrating the
framework’s potential for efficiently detecting the origins of climate extremes and quantitatively assessing the impacts of mitigation
policies for sustainable development.","INTRODUCTION
Heatwaves pose widespread yet disproportionate threats to the
ecosystems and human well-being across the globe, and these
associated adverse effects are further exacerbated by mega-
heatwaves with long durations and large amplitude1–5. Central-
eastern China, with accelerating climate change and population
aging, is particularly vulnerable to increasing and intensifying
heatwaves6–8. In the mid-to-late summer of 2022, a record-
breaking mega-heatwave roasted broad swathes of China, among
which the central-eastern region is considered the hardest-hit
(Fig. 1). This “heatwave from the hell” with scorching temperature
exceeding 40 °C at some stations, superimposed by droughts and
wildfires, is among the most severe recorded in global history9,10.
Close to one billion people were affected by the scorching hot, as
well as the heatwave-caused energy crisis, i.e., water and
electricity shortages10. Given that more deadly heatwaves are
projected in the future, quantifying the casual factors of mega-
heatwave and further disentangling the origin of the uncertainties
of heatwave prediction can provide impact-based decision-
making support for disaster mitigation and prevention11–14. While
several studies attributed the extremely hot summer in 2022 to
extra-tropical atmospheric circulation, tropical sea surface tem-
perature, and local soil moisture–temperature feedback, the latter
being a comprehensive quantitative attribution of the multiple
dynamical and radiative drivers on the occurrence of this mega-
heatwave is absent15–20. In fact, this attribution gap exists in
almost the entire research community for climate and weather
extremes.
Typically, the development, maintenance, and attenuation of
heatwaves involve both dynamical and radiative processes21–27.
During the development and maintenance of a certain heatwave,
a high-pressure system that produces clear skies allows more solar
radiation to reach the ground, inducing an anomalous surface
warming21,25. Upward surface heat fluxes are thus generated,
along with adiabatic subsidence, leading to an increase in air
temperature, maintaining the local high-pressure system and
hence the heatwave21,25. Collapses of the high-pressure system
and local land-atmosphere feedback contribute to the termination
of heatwave21,25. In addition to these typical processes, the
evolution of heatwave may also be modulated by the radiative
processes associated with the changes in aerosols and water
vapor, among others28,29. For example, an increased amount of
aerosols can reduce the surface temperature and hence the
probability
of
heatwave
occurrence
through
absorption
or
scattering of shortwave radiation, and vice versa24. Given the
well-recognized
processes
associated
with
the
lifecycle
of
heatwaves mentioned above, a fundamental question remains:
What are the relative roles of those dynamical and radiative
processes in the different phases of heatwaves?
According to the total energy balance equation, the tempera-
ture change-induced longwave cooling is balanced by multiple
physical processes in an equilibrium state. In light of such a
premise, several climate attribution methods including but not
limited to the partial radiative perturbation method30 (PRP) and
the
coupled
atmosphere–surface
climate
feedback–response
analysis method31,32 (CFRAM), have been developed to quantify
the contributions from individual processes to radiative forcings at
the top of the atmosphere/surface and to air/surface temperatures
changes from seasonal to decadal time scales33–37. However, these
methods are not applicable in a non-equilibrium state, where
weather and climate extreme events lie in. On the other hand, the
moist static energy (MSE) budget38 with energy unbalanced,
which is an indicative of total energy budget, has been intensively
adopted to quantify the contributions from physical processes in
the lifecycle of intra-seasonal oscillation (e.g., Madden–Julian
Oscillation and boreal summer intra-se

The Earth’s surface temperatures have increased significantly since the beginning of industrialisation. The high emissions of
greenhouse gases have contributed to global warming and climate change, which is expected to continue. Here, we investigate the
long-term trends of surface temperature in India using surface, satellite and reanalysis data for the period of 1980–2020, and assess
the influence of geophysical drivers on temperature change using the causal discovery. The highest mean surface temperatures are
observed in the southern India and the lowest in Himalaya in accordance with the incidence of solar radiation. Causal discovery
reveals the relative influence of atmospheric processes, aerosols and specific humidity on surface temperature. We observe a
positive trend in temperature during pre-monsoon (0.1–0.3 °C dec−1) and post-monsoon (0.2–0.4 °C dec−1) seasons in the
northwest, northeast and north-central India. The analysis exposes high annual (0.22 ± 0.14 °C dec−1) and monsoon
(0.24 ± 0.08 °C dec−1) warming in the northeast India. Post-monsoon season shows a positive trend in the entire India, where the
highest value is estimated for the western Himalaya (0.2–0.5 °C dec−1) and northeast India (0.1–0.4 °C dec−1). Analyses with the
Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6) results show that temperature can increase up to 1.1–5.1 °C by year 2100 under
the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP5)–8.5 scenario. The increasing trend of temperature in India is a big concern, which calls
for adaption and mitigation measures to alleviate adverse effects of accelerated warming and regional climate change.","INTRODUCTION
Surface temperature is the key component of the Earth’s energy
balance, and its change decides weather and climate of a region1.
Human-caused greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have increased
significantly since the pre-industrial era, causing earth’s atmo-
sphere to warm2,3. The global surface temperature is expected to
increase up to 1.4–5.8 °C by the end of twenty-first century, which
would likely to increase the magnitude and frequency of extreme
events such as heat waves, droughts, increased precipitation and
wildfires3,4. Several studies have already been conducted to
examine the impact of climate change and its influence on
extreme weather events5,6.
The study of temperature variability requires special attention
since the warming is not uniform across the latitudes7,8. During
the twentieth century, the worldwide mean surface air tempera-
ture has increased by around 0.5 °C3,9,10. Analysis and monitoring
of air temperature on global and regional scales have attracted a
lot of attention in recent decades due to apparent indicators of
widespread warming and climate change. As a result, much
importance has been given to regional temperature change as
that would affect the weather and climate of the regions2.
According to previous studies, India’s surface temperature has
significantly increased during the past two decades7,11,12. The
annual minimum temperature shows a rise in most parts of India
at 0.24 °C dec−1 from 1980 to 201013, demonstrating a significant
exacerbation in surface temperatures14,15. A positive trend in the
diurnal range of temperature has been observed over India from
1901 to 20037,16. South India shows relatively more warming17,
which is contributed by the rising maximum (1 °C 100 yr−1) and
minimum (0.3 °C 100 yr−1) surface temperatures during the period
1901–2007. Many studies on the surface urban heat island
intensity suggested that urbanisation can be a reason for the rise
in temperature in Indian cities18,19. Dimri20 also reported a notable
warming in India and its sub-regions by using gridded data from
the
India
Meteorological
Department
(IMD)
and
reanalysis
data sets.
According to Kothawale and Kumar7, the average annual
maximum temperature has increased by around 0.07 °C dec−1
from 1901 to 2003, whereas the minimum temperature showed
no change. Srivastava et al.21 examined decadal changes in
surface temperature of India, and found widespread cooling and
warming in the southern and northern India, respectively.
Although the trends in mean temperature over India were
identical to hemispheric and global trends, Rupa Kumar et al.22
noted that the diurnal asymmetry of surface temperature across
India varied significantly from that recorded elsewhere in the
world. Krishnan and Ramanathan23 assert that surface tempera-
ture from January to May decreased up to 0.3 °C in India during
the period 1968–1997, after excluding the impact of GHGs and
natural variability from the data. According to Kothawale and
Rupa Kumar7, India’s annual minimum and maximum tempera-
tures have also increased significantly in 1971–2003. As analysed
by Kothawale et al.8, the all-India mean, maximum and minimum
temperatures have increased by 0.51, 0.71 and 0.27 °C per 100
year, respectively, from 1901 to 2007, with an accelerated
warming during the period of 1971–2007.
Causal discovery has emerged as a prevalent approach in recent
studies to understand the teleconnections among different
climate parameters. For example, Runge et al.24 revealed causal
relationship between geophysical drivers and land air temperature
in specific regions like British Columbia. They found that the causal
discovery well detected the teleconnection between monthly
climate index Niño (3.4 region) and temperature variability in
these regions at a significance level of 5% within a maximum lag

The potential of the mesopelagic zone (200–1000 m depth) to provide natural resources and ecosystem services is of increasing
interest to a broad range of societal stakeholders. As this interest grows, divergent ideas about its current and future role in
supporting human life are being expressed in scientific and public discourse. We use automated content analysis to identify 13 key
topics about the mesopelagic zone from 2226 scientific abstracts and 4066 tweets. Two dominant ideas emerge: (1) the exploitation
of fish resources and (2) the role of the mesopelagic zone as a carbon sink. We find that, in the absence of significant mesopelagic
zone policy, science plays a de facto governing role by shaping how the ecosystem is known to the public and policymakers alike.
These results indicate the need and potential for new knowledge and governance arrangements that can broaden the range of
meanings and knowledge needed to anticipate future uses of deeply uncertain ecosystems and resources.","INTRODUCTION
The mesopelagic zone, extending between 200 m and 1000 m
depth in the world’s oceans, constitutes one of the largest yet
least understood ecosystems on the planet1,2. Scientific engage-
ment with the mesopelagic zone has a long history, from the
Challenger expedition of 1872–18763, to the identification of the
“deep scattering layer” with echo-sounding technology in the 20th
century4. Deep-sea fishing programmes were run by South Africa
and the former USSR in the 1970s and, more recently, by Iceland
and Norway in the 2000s5. Scientific interest in the mesopelagic
zone
has
grown
rapidly
in
the
21st
century6,7
(see
also
Supplementary Fig. 1), largely funded by the European Union
and United States8,9.
Deep-sea scientists argue that it is necessary to produce new
knowledge in order to understand the mesopelagic zone and its
current and potential role in supporting human life through
climate regulation and marine food systems10. Attempts to
quantify these dimensions of the mesopelagic zone have so far
been accompanied by wide uncertainty ranges. For example,
estimates of atmospheric carbon sequestration through the
mesopelagic zone’s biological carbon pump range between 2–6
billion metric tons per year globally – at least equivalent to twice
all car emissions worldwide5,11. Gross estimates of available fish
resources also vary considerably from 1.8 Gt12 to 19.5 Gt13 – with
some scientists shaping expectations that fishing these resources
could double global fisheries landings6.
Scientists and the work they produce are thus central to current
and future decision-making over the deep sea. By measuring and
codifying the natural world, science is responsible for rendering
nature ‘legible’ to states and publics alike14. A legible natural
world is one that is measured and simplified, making it suitable for
manipulation, experimentation, and, ultimately, governance14. In
making the natural world legible, science, often with state
support, plays a role in supporting and legitimising political
decisions about environmental management15, contributing to
the transformation of the natural world into resources16. In this
way, science explicitly interacts with state rules that can steer
resource extraction through de jure state-led, legally binding
forms of governance17.
In addition to contributing to de jure governance processes,
science can also exert de facto governing power. By studying
seemingly apolitical technical questions in anticipation of future
uses of the natural world, scientists directly shape what can be
governed and how. From their authoritative position in society,
and their exclusive role in accessing the mesopelagic zone,
scientific
assessments
can
(inadvertently)
shift
governance
debates from first-order ‘what, if and whether’ questions to those
that normalise and institutionalise certain activities18. By rendering
the natural world legible, scientific work becomes a de facto
means of shaping how resources are fundamentally understood
and valued, as well as the principles that ultimately define state
and private sector rules and action for conservation and/or

subject to the same oversight as de jure state-based forms of
regulation. In light of the growing interest in the mesopelagic
zone, it is therefore increasingly important to understand and
reflect upon the role science is already playing in the governance
of this ecosystem.

Adaptive fishery responses to climate-induced changes in marine fish populations may lead to fishery maladaptation. Using a
stylised bio-economic model of the global fishery, we demonstrate the importance of adaptive management regimes. We show
how the losses resulting from poor access regulation increase in a fishery system negatively impacted by environmental change,
and demonstrate the proportional benefits provided by management strategies that control the levels and allocation of fishing
effort. Indeed, under poor to nonexistent access regulation, highly adaptive actors can generate significant bio-economic losses.
This might lead to foregone benefits and cascading economic and ecological losses, whereas well-designed adaptive management
regimes may enable making the most of the best, and the least of the worst, climate-induced outcomes for fisheries. These findings
emphasize the need for integrated assessment approaches to the impacts of climate change on fisheries, that should incorporate
not only ecological responses but also the industry and management responses.","INTRODUCTION
A growing number of ecological studies show that climate change is
likely to entail significant impacts on marine ecosystems globally,
with ensuing changes in the productivity of marine fisheries1 and in
the spatial distribution of fish stocks2,3. Expected changes in marine
animal biomasses by 2100 include declines in most oceanic areas,
with strong heterogeneity across regions and species3,4.
The discourse on the need for adaptation to climate change has
increasingly occupied centre stage in relation to these major changes
occurring in the fish communities exploited by commercial fisheries.
Whether to benefit from or to best cope with these changes,
adaptation is commonly viewed as a positive force whereas fisheries
are often represented as a fairly static force in these ecological
studies (e.g.5), with limited consideration of likely responses by
economic actors (although exceptions exist such as adjusting supply
and demand models to climate change6). Implicit in the calls for
industry to develop adaptation strategies is the assumption that such
adaptation would necessarily result in positive outcomes. While the
study of economic adaptation in fisheries has attracted growing
interest7–9, numerical analyses of fisheries responses to climate-
induced ecosystem changes remain limited.
Here,
we
examine
the
circumstances
under
which
such
responses may lead to positive or negative outcomes on both
economic returns and fish stock sustainability. Our main contribu-
tion lies in showing that adaptive economic actors without
adaptive management (i.e., the capacity to adjust regulations of
fishing effort levels) may lead to fishery maladaptation (i.e.,
decreased
long-term
economic
returns
and
biomass
levels
associated with fisheries responses).
As stressed by Papaioannou et al.10, fisheries can respond to
shifting species distributions by changing fishing grounds or
target species. A number of studies have been carried out at the
global level to assess the implication of those responses5,11. To
examine the consequences of such adaptation, we built on the
stylized model of the global fishery by the World Bank12 which
treated the world’s marine fisheries as one single aggregate
fishery and estimated substantial economic losses in the year
2012 (“the Sunken Billions”, hereafter SB model) due to poor
fisheries management. We developed a dynamic version of the
SB model (hereafter SB-Dyn, see Methods) which includes four
“métiers” representing the combinations of two species fished in
two fishing regions (métiers 1–4, see Supplementary Table 1). To
represent the spatial and species-specific heterogeneity in
climate impacts, we assumed that ecosystem changes lead to
a 25% reduction in the carrying capacity in one métier only
(métier 3)5,13. We modelled two levels of responses to this
change (see Supplementary Material for details of the model):
(i)
ecological drift: the spatial distribution of the affected fish
species adjusts to changes in carrying capacity and biomass
density across regions;
(ii)
fishing effort allocation: within management constraints,
fishing activity is reallocated to métiers with highest
anticipated economic margins.
We simulated the expected evolution of the fishery using the
level of fishing effort of the SB model in the reference year12,
defining this level of effort as our status quo (see Supplementary
Fig. 1). Next, we considered two archetypal management regimes,
which differed in terms of fishery access regulation and effort
limitation:
–
Open Access: the fishery reverts to unrestricted entry/exit of
fishing effort in all métiers, leading to a dynamic adjustment
towards zero profit levels14;
–
Adaptive management for Maximum Sustainable or Economic
Yield (MSY/MEY): optimal effort maximising yield or profit at
steady state is calculated, then recomputed to account for
ecosystem change with a lag reflecting delays in management
planning and implementation.

In ocean areas beyond national jurisdiction, various legal regimes and governance structures result in diffused responsibility and
create challenges for management. Here we show those challenges are set to expand with climate change driving increasing
overlap between eastern Pacific tuna fisheries and the emerging industry of deep-sea mining. Climate models suggest that tuna
distributions will shift in the coming decades. Within the Clarion-Clipperton Zone of the Pacific Ocean, a region containing 1.1
million km2 of deep-sea mining exploration contracts, the total biomass for bigeye, skipjack, and yellowfin tuna species are
forecasted to increase relative to today under two tested climate-change scenarios. Percentage increases are 10–11% for bigeye,
30–31% for skipjack, and 23% for yellowfin. The interactions between mining, fish populations, and climate change are complex
and unknown. However, these projected increases in overlap indicate that the potential for conflict and resultant environmental
and economic repercussions will be exacerbated in a climate-altered ocean. This has implications for the holistic and sustainable
management of this area, with pathways suggested for closing these critical gaps.","INTRODUCTION
The ocean constitutes 71% of the Earth’s surface, and nearly two-
thirds of this are areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ, or for
the water column ‘the high seas’). Within ABNJ, there are different
legal regimes and governance structures for the non-living
resources (e.g., minerals) and the living resources (e.g., fishes).
The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)
created a central intergovernmental agency, the International
Seabed Authority (ISA), that has responsibility to govern activities
relating to minerals and the ABNJ seafloor, as well as the resulting
potential environmental impacts1. The same Convention provides
a legal regime for the use, conservation, and management of
high-seas fishery resources2. These legal rules are generally
implemented via regional fisheries management organisations
(RFMOs), created to regulate economically-important highly-
migratory fish stocks in ABNJ3. RFMOs themselves differ in their
scope, approach, and mandate, with five RFMOs that address
highly migratory tuna stocks and tuna-like species such as marlin
or swordfish. While some stocks are considered healthy4,5, there
are significant gaps in coverage and ineffective management for
others6. These multiple designations have diffused responsibility
for ABNJ, creating challenges for the management of marine
resources in the high
seas, especially when the
separate
management of the living and non-living resources may result
in conflicting strategies.
The Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ) is a large area (4.5 million
km2) located between Hawai‘i and Mexico in the eastern Pacific
Ocean7. There is high environmental heterogeneity across this
area, demonstrated by primary productivity increasing west to
east and north to south, dissolved oxygen concentrations
influenced by the presence of a mobile oxygen minimum zone
in the water column, and high densities of polymetallic nodules
on the seafloor8,9. These nodules have attracted commercial
interest in deep-sea mining, with 17 exploration contracts
currently issued across the region by the ISA, covering a quarter
of the area of the CCZ seabed (1.125 million km2) (https://

There are also commercial fish stocks of tuna in the CCZ, with
this region falling under the jurisdiction of two tuna RFMOs: the
Inter-American
Tropical
Tuna
Commission
(IATTC)
and
the
Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC)10.
These two RFMOs oversee three of the main Pacific tuna species:
bigeye (Thunnus obesus), skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis), and
yellowfin (T. albacares) tuna. Together, fisheries targeting these
species captured 3.5 million tonnes (IATTC 687,000 tonnes and
WCPFC 2.9 million tonnes) in 2022, which was 66% of global tuna
catches reported that year5,11. Within the CCZ and surrounding
waters, catches for these species average 35,000 to 78,000 tonnes
per year10. These are some of the most profitable fisheries in the
world; market price (i.e., dock price) fluctuates between $1,000
USD per tonne for skipjack tuna to over $5,000 USD for bigeye
tuna, reaching an end value of over $10,000 USD per tonne12. In
total, the economic value of these three species within these two
RFMOs fluctuate around $5.5 billion USD per year (WCPFC $4.3
billion USD, IATTC $1.2 billion USD)13 (
If deep-sea mineral exploration projects, currently operational in
the CCZ, are permitted by the ISA to move to an exploitation
phase,
substantial
environmental
impacts
would

be
caused14–17. Additionally, conflict between fisheries and deep-
sea mining will likely occur given the existing spatial overlap
within and around the CCZ10. There are at least four different
mechanisms by which nodule mining in the CCZ could negatively
impact fisheries specifically. However, the extent of these impacts
is
largely
unknown
and/or
debated,

given
